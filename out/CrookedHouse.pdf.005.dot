    Introduction [label="Americans are considered crazy anywhere in the world.
They will usually concede a basis for the accusation but point to California as the focus of the infection."]
    
    ArchitectIdea [label="Quintus Teal regarded the efforts of his colleagues in architecture as faint-hearted, fumbling, and timid."]
    
    TesseractConcept [label="Bailey reached up and shook his arm. 'Snap out of it. What the hell are you talking about, four dimensions? Time is the fourth dimension; you can't drive nails into that."]
    
    HouseConstruction [label="Things are done fast in southern California. Ordinary houses there are usually built in a month's time. Under Teal's impassioned heckling the tesseract house climbed dizzily skyward in days rather than weeks, and its cross-shaped second story came jutting out at the four corners of the world."]
    
    EarthquakeEffect [label="By the way, they will drive you up Laurel Canyon 'where we keep the violent cases.' The Canyonites—the brown-legged women, the trunks-clad men constantly busy building and rebuilding their slap-happy unfinished houses—regard with faint contempt the dull creatures who live down in the flats."]
    
    HouseCollapses [label="Great jumping cats!' he yelled, 'I've been robbed!' He broke into a run.
Front or back, the story was the same: the other seven rooms had disappeared, vanished completely."]
    
    StrangeExperiences [label="They found themselves standing in the middle one of the five rooms which constituted the second floor of the original structure."]
    
    EscapeAttempts [label="Teal went back to the window and gazed down the series of rooms through which he had pursued the mysterious stranger."]
    
    FinalCollapse [label="It was gone. There was not even the ground floor room. It had vanished."]
