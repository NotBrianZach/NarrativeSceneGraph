:: Call_me_Ishmael <2719,556>

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little
or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought
I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have
of driving oﬀ the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I ﬁnd myself
growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my
soul; whenever I ﬁnd myself involuntarily pausing before coﬃn warehouses, and
bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos
get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent
me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s
hats oﬀ—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. is is my
substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical ﬂourish Cato throws himself
upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. ere is nothing surprising in this. If
they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

:: But_here_is_an_artist <202,1226>

But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest,
most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is
the chief element he employs? ere stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,
as if a hermit and a cruciﬁx were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there
sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into dis-
tant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains
bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the piure lies thus tranced, and though
this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all
were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were ﬁxed upon the magic stream before him.
Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-
deep among Tiger- lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not
a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a catara of sand, would you travel your
thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly
receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he
sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why
is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time
or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your ﬁrst voyage as a passenger, did you
yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when ﬁrst told that you and your ship were
now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did
the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not
without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who
because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,
plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all
rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is

:: Now__when_I_say_that_I_am_in_the_habit_of_going... <1103,1014>

Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow
hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean
to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you
must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.
Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do
not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;
nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinion of such oﬃces to those
who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respeable toils, trials,
and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take
care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what
not. And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in
that, a cook being a sort of oﬃcer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied
broiling fowls; —though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically
salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respefully, not to say
reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the
old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies
of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb
down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather
order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in
a May meadow. And at ﬁrst, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches
one’s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the
land, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a
country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. e transition
is a keen one, I assure you, from the schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong
decoion of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this
wears oﬀ in time.

:: Finally__I_always_go_to_sea_as_a_sailor__becaus... <2871,2333>

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and
pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more preval-
ent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim),
so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at
second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it ﬁrst; but
not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspe it. But wherefore it
was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now
take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police oﬃcer
of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and
inﬂuences me in some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one
else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort
of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that
this part of the bill must have run something like this:

ough I cannot tell why it was exaly that those stage managers, the Fates, put
me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for
magniﬁcent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies,
and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot tell why this was exaly; yet, now that
I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set
about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was
a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale him-
self. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. en the
wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless
perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian

As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this
same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related
that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no
other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a ﬁne, boisterous something about
everything conneed with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business
of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind
her, yet Nantucket was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place
where the ﬁrst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, ﬁrst sally out in canoes to give chase
to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that ﬁrst adventurous
little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobble-stones—so goes the story
—to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk
a harpoon from the bowsprit?

With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “e Crossed Har-
poons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright
red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn”, there came such fervent rays, that it seemed
to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere
else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather
weary for me, when I struck my foot against the ﬂinty projeions, because from
hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.
Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad
glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on,
Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched
boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instin followed the streets
that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest
inns.

Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here
and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night,
of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But
presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of
which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses
of the public; so, entering, the ﬁrst thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in
the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the ﬂying particles almost choked me, are these
ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But “e Crossed Harpoons”, and
“e Sword-Fish?”—this, then, must needs be the sign of “e Trap”. However, I
picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second,
interior door.

It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it
were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tem-
pestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor
Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any
one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of
that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I
possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous diﬀerence, whether thou
lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or
whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both
sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought I,
as this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes,
these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they
didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here
and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. e universe is ﬁn-
ished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted oﬀ a million years ago. Poor
Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shak-
ing oﬀ his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and
put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous
Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper—(he had a
redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a ﬁne frosty night; how Orion glitters;
what northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting
conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own
coals.

Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, strag-
gling entry with old- fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some
condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oil-painting so thoroughly
besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal cross-lights by which you
viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and
careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding
of its purpose. such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at ﬁrst you
almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags,
had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest
contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the
little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion
that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.

But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the piure over three blue,
dim, perpendicular lines ﬂoating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy
piure truly, enough to drive a nervous man distraed. Yet was there a sort of
indeﬁnite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to ﬁnd out what that mar-
vellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would
dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.—It’s the unnatural com-
bat of the four primal elements.—It’s a blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter
scene.—It’s the breaking- up of the ice-bound stream of Time. But at last all these
fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the piure’s midst. at once
found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance
to a gigantic ﬁsh? even the great Leviathan himself?

e opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of
monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resem-
bling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-
shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-
mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered
what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with
such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling
lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With
this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, ﬁfty years ago did Nathan Swain kill
ﬁfteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon—so like a cork-
screw now—was ﬂung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterward
slain oﬀ the Cape of Blanco. e original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a
restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last
was found imbedded in the hump.

Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut through
what in old times must have been a great central chimney with ﬁre-places all
round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with such low
ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would
almost fancy you trod some old craft’s cockpits, especially of such a howling night,
when this corner- anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a
long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, ﬁlled with dusty rarit-
ies gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projeing from the further
angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a Right
Whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale’s
jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. within are shabby shelves,
ranged round with old decanters, bottles, ﬂasks; and in those jaws of swift destruc-
tion, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles
a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums
and death.

A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was ﬂung open, and
in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and
with their heads muﬄed in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their
beards stiﬀ with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. ey had
just landed from their boat, and this was the ﬁrst house they entered. No wonder,
then, that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the
wrinkled little old Jonah, there oﬃciating, soon poured them out brimmers all
round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him
a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for
all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether
caught oﬀ the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of an ice- island.

I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he
seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face,
yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. is man
interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon
become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative
is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full
six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coﬀer-dam. I have
seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making
his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes
ﬂoated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice
at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his ﬁne stature, I thought
he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleganian Ridge in Virginia.
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped
away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the
sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it
seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington!
Bulkington! where’s Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had
occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.

I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk
handkerchief ﬁrst dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the
while grinning like an ape. e shavings ﬂew right and left; till at last the plane-
iron came bump against an indestruible knot. e landlord was near spraining
his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit —the bed was soft enough to suit
me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down
of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing
them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business,
and left me in a brown study.

way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed

But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light,
and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfaory
conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, orna-
mented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine
quills round an Indian moccasin. ere was a hole or slit in the middle of this
mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of
any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me
down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little
damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I
went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight
in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the
neck.

But I lay perfely still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a
light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger
entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good
way oﬀ from me on the ﬂoor in one corner, and then began working away at the
knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all
eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
unlacing the bag’s mouth. is accomplished, however, he turned round—when,

thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a ﬁght, got dreadfully cut, and here
he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face
so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all,
those black squares on his cheeks. they were stains of some sort or other. At ﬁrst I
knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.
I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the
cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the
course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what
is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of
skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean,
lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be
sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of
a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never
been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary
eﬀes upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like
lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some diﬃculty having
opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of
tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest
in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing
enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took oﬀ his hat—a new
beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. ere was no hair
on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp- knot twisted
up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a
mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would
have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.

Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was
the second ﬂoor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling
purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear,
and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, i confess i
was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken
into my room at the dead of night. In fa, I was so afraid of him that I was not
game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfaory answer concern-
ing what seemed inexplicable in him. Meanwhile, he continued the business of
undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts
of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all
over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a irty Years’ War, and
just escaped from it with a sticking- plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were
marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young
palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other
shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian
country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his

own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about some-
thing that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must
indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which
he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at
length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exaly the
color of a three days’ old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at ﬁrst
I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some sim-
ilar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good
deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol,
which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty ﬁreplace,
and removing the papered ﬁre-board, sets up this little hunchbacked image, like
a tenpin, between the andirons. the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were
very sooty, so that I thought this ﬁre-place made a very appropriate little shrine or
chapel for his Congo idol.

I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at
ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double
handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the
idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the ﬂame from the lamp,
he kindled the shavings into a sacriﬁcial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches
into the ﬁre, and still hastier withdrawals of his ﬁngers (whereby he seemed to
be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then
blowing oﬀ the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite oﬀer of it to the little
negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he
never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger
guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else
singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in
the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the ﬁre, he took the idol up very
unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were
a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.

Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown over
me in the most loving and aﬀeionate manner. You had almost thought I had been
his wife. e counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares
and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan
labyrinth of a ﬁgure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I
suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I say, looked
for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on
it as the arm did when I ﬁrst awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so
blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure
that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.

My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child,
I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was
a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. e circumstance was this. I
had been cutting up some caper or other—I think it was trying to crawl up the
chimney, as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother
who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed
supperless,—my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed
me oﬀ to bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the st June, the
longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help
for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third ﬂoor, undressed myself as
slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I
could hope for a resurreion. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached
to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a
great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the
house. I felt worse and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in

my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her
feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my mis-
behavior; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable
length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and
back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling
a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent
misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the before
sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running
through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but
a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,
and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand be-
longed, sseated by my bedside. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,
frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever think-
ing that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I
knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the
morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months
afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to
this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.

Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural
hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experi-
enced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm thrown round me. But at
length all the past night’s events soberly recurred, one by one, in ﬁxed reality, and
then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his
arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me
tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my neck
feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch. rowing
aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s side, as
if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a
strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in
the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling,
and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging
a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extraing a grunt;
and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland
dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiﬀ as a pike-staﬀ, looking at me,
and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there,
though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawn-
ing over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his
mind seemed made up touching the charaer of his bedfellow, and he became, as

and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress ﬁrst and
then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. inks I,
Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth
is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous
how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, be-
cause he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of
great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;
for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man
like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual
regarding.

He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,
by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his boots. What
under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush
himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the bed; when, from sundry violent
gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though
by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when
putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
state —neither caterpillar nor butterﬂy. He was just enough civilized to show oﬀ
his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner. his education was not yet
completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree civilized,
he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,
if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under
the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and
crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room,
as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him at
the ﬁrst go oﬀ of a bitter cold morning.

about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could,
to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as
soon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time
in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my
amazement, contented himself with restriing his ablutions to his chest, arms,
and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on
the wash-stand centre-table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his
face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he ta+es

Had it not been for us whalemen, that tra of land would this day perhaps have
been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her back
country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. e town itself is perhaps
the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough;
but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. e streets do not run with
milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of
this, nowhere in all America will you ﬁnd more patrician-like houses; parks and
gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted
upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?

Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my
way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered congregation
of sailors, and sailors’ wives and widows. A muﬄed silence reigned, only broken at
times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting
apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. e
chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat
steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall
on either side the pulpit. ree of them ran something like the following, but I
do not pretend to quote:—

the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in
his countenance. is savage was the only person present who seemed to notice
my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore,
was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives
of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I
knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the ﬁshery, and so plainly
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some
unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old
wounds to bleed afresh.

doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me, Yes, Ishmael,

ducements to embark, ﬁne chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will
make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Me-
thinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that
what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in
looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through
the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body
is but the lees of my better being. In fa take my body who will, take it I say, it

I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered;
immediately as the storm- pelted door ﬂew back upon admitting him, a quick
regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, suﬃciently attested that this ﬁne
old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by
the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a sailor
and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life
to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy
winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second
ﬂowering youth, for among all the ﬁssures of his wrinkles, there shone certain
mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even
beneath February’s snow. No one having previously heard his history, could for the
ﬁrst time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were
certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous
maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with
melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the
ﬂoor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and
overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent
corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.

But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed
from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either
hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large paint-
ing representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm oﬀ a lee coast of
black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the ﬂying scud and dark-rolling
clouds, there ﬂoated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s
face; and this bright face shed a distin spot of radiance upon the ship’s tossed
deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the Viory’s plank where
Nelson fell. ”Ah, noble ship,“ the angel seemed to say, ”beat on, beat on, thou
noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds
are rolling oﬀ—serenest azure is at hand“.

“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of
the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of
the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this
prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the ﬁsh’s belly! How billow- like
and boisterously grand! We feel the ﬂoods surging over us; we sound with him
to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about
us! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-
stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of
the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the
sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance,
prayers, and ﬁnally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among
men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command
of God—never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed—which he
found a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for
us to do—remember that—and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors
to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.

With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further ﬂouts at God, by
seeking to ﬂee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him into
countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks
about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. ere lurks,
perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have
been no other city than the modern Cadiz. at’s the opinion of learned men.
And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa,
as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was
an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaﬀa, shipmates, is on the
most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more
than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of
Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to ﬂee world-wide from

God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping
like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his
look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion
of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a
fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany
him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he ﬁnds
the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to
see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in
the goods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to
look all ease and conﬁdence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions
of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but
still serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe,
do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer that
broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.”
Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which
the ship is moored, oﬀering ﬁve hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a
parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from
Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,
prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning
all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not
confess himself suspeed; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best
of it; and when the sailors ﬁnd him not to be the man that is advertised, they let
him pass, and he descends into the cabin.

papers for the Customs—“Who’s there?” Oh! how that harmless question mangles
Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to ﬂee again. But he rallies. “I seek a passage
in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?” us far the busy captain had not
looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he
hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. “We sail with the next
coming tide,” at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. “No sooner,
sir?”—“Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.” Ha! Jonah, that’s
another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. “I’ll sail with
ye,”—he says,—“the passage money, how much is that,—I’ll pay now.“ For it is
particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this
history,“that he paid the fare thereof ” ere the craft did sail. And taken with the
context, this is full of meaning.

at the same time resolves to help a ﬂight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when
Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He
rings every coin to ﬁnd a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and
Jonah is put down for his passage. “Point out my state-room, Sir,” says Jonah now.
“I’m travel-weary; I need sleep.” “ou look’st like it,” says the Captain, “there’s
thy room.” Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key.
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and
mutters something about the doors of convis’ cells being never allowed to be
locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth,
and ﬁnds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. e air is
close, and Jonah gasps. then, in that contraed hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship’s

is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides
of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the
frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, “What meanest thou,
O sleeper! arise!” Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to
his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But
at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks.
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and ﬁnding no speedy vent runs roaring
fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet aﬂoat. And ever,
as the white moon shows her aﬀrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness
overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon
beat downward again towards the tormented deep.

Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing atti-
tudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. e sailors mark him; more and
more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by re-
ferring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose
cause this great tempest was upon them. e lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then
how furiously they mob him with their questions. “What is thine occupation?
whence comest thou? thy country? what people?” but mark now, my shipmates,
the behavior of poor Jonah. e eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where
from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise an-
other answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced
from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.

the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like the Lord out of the ﬁsh’s belly. But
observe his prayer, and so many white bolts, upon his prison. en Jonah prayed
unto learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for
dire deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his
deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and
pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true
and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.
And how pleasing to God was this condu in Jonah, is shown in the eventual
deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah
before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for
repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.”

But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with
an aspe of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words: “Shipmates,
God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I have
read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all
sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than
ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on
the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you
reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me as a pilot of
the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things,
and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked
Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, ﬂed from his mission,
and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is
everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him
in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift
slantings tore him along “into the midst of the seas,“ where the eddying depths
sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and” the weeds were wrapped about his
head,“ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond
the reach of any plummet—“out of the belly of hell”—when the whale grounded
upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting
prophet when he cried. en God spake unto the ﬁsh; and from the shuddering

to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly
enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a
sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.
Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far
upward, and inward delight —who against the proud gods and commodores of
this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down
beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns,
and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and
Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord,
but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom
all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from
this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who
coming to lay him down, can say with his ﬁnal breath—O Father!—chieﬂy known

With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously
marred about the face—at least to my taste —his countenance yet had a something
in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. rough all
his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and
in his large, deep eyes, ﬁery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that
would dare a thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bear-
ing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He
looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether
it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not
venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one.
It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s head, as seen
in the popular busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope

Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be look-
ing out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never
troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied
with counting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we
had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the aﬀec-
tionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought
this indiﬀerence of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you
do not know exaly how to take them. At ﬁrst they are overawing; their calm
self-colleedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that
Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the
inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the
circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second
thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty
thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the
only way he could get there —thrown among people as strange to him as though
he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.
Surely this was a touch of ﬁne philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard
there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals
should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or
such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic
old woman, he must have ”broken his digester.”

when, after its ﬁrst intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked
at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering
in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells;
I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my
splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolﬁsh world. is
soothing savage had redeemed it. ere he sat, his very indiﬀerence speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he
was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn
towards him. And those same things that would have repelled most others, they
were the very magnets that thus drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since
Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him,
and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him mean-
while. At ﬁrst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to
his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little

I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presby-
terian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping
his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ish-
mael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans and all included
—can possibly be jealous of an insigniﬁcant bit of black wood? Impossible! But
what is worship?—to do the will of God— that is worship. And what is the will
of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to
me— that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I
wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular
Presbyterian form of worship. consequently, i must then unite with him in his;
ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent
little idol; oﬀered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or
thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with
our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some

Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to
grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes
well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn
up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our knee-pans were
warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of
doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no ﬁre in the room. e
more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must
be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.
Nothing exists in itself. If you ﬂatter yourself that you are all over comfortable,
and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more.
But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your
head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel
most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment
should never be furnished with a ﬁre, which is one of the luxurious discomforts
of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the
blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. en there
you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an aric crystal.

to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own
pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of
the unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion.
Nor did I at all obje to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to
strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong
desire to have a few quiet puﬀs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had
felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see
how elastic our stiﬀ prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For
now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed,
because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no more felt
unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the
condensed conﬁdential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the
Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging
tester of smoke, illuminated by the ﬂame of the new-lit lamp.

A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to
Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his
suit; and not all the King his father’s inﬂuence could prevail. But Queequeg vowed
a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled oﬀ to a distant strait, which he knew the
ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef;
on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out
into the water. Hiding his canoe, still aﬂoat, among these thickets, with its prow
seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was
gliding by, like a ﬂash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of
his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing himself
at full length upon the deck, grappled a ringbolt there, and swore not to let it go,
though hacked in pieces.

put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar
Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no
seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening
his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he was auated by a
profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people
still happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they were. But,
alas! the praices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could
be both miserable and wicked; inﬁnitely more so, than all his father’s heathens.
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then
going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,
poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. ought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians;

coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being very
old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that he
was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unﬁtted him for ascending the
pure and undeﬁled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he
said, he would return,—as soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce,
however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. ey
had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future move-
ments. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him
that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out
of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to
embark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard
the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me,
in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the
Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the aﬀeion
I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could
not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the
mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant
seamen.

poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down
to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we
were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much —for they were used
to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such
conﬁdential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by
turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon
barbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
whether all whaling ships did not ﬁnd their own harpoons. To this, in substance,
he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular
aﬀeion for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuﬀ, well tried in many a
mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many
inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their
own scythes —though in no wise obliged to furnished them—even so, Queequeg,
for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.

Upon this, he told me another story. e people of his island of Rokovoko, it
seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into
a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the
great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a cer-
tain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from
all accounts, a very stately punilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain —this
commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a pretty young
princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at
the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post
of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest
and his majesty the King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people
have their grace as well as we —though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who
at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the
ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I say, being said,
the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island;
that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating ﬁngers into the bowl before the
blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the
ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain pre-
cedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own house—the Captain
coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch bowl;—taking it i suppose for
a huge ﬁnger-glass. “Now,“ said Queequeg, “what you tink now,—Didn’t our
people laugh?”

tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bow-
sprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a
lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so compan-
ionable; as though a white man were anything more digniﬁed than a whitewashed
negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense
greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg
caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the
bumpkin’s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage
caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent
him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset,
the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his
back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puﬀ.

But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind

sheet, and the tremendous boom was now ﬂying from side to side, completely
sweeping the entire after part of the deck. e poor fellow whom Queequeg had

snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It ﬂew from right to left, and
back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point
of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of
being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as
if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this consternation,
Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom,
whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then ﬂinging the
other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the

rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.

Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach,
without a background. ere is more sand there than you would use in twenty
years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell you that
they have to plant weeds there, they don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada
thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask;
that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in
Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the
shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in
a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander
snowshoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded,
and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small
clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.

three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba

the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but
ﬂoating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen

Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells
like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With
the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between bil-
lows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays
him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and
Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least
none but a supper and a bed. e landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommen-
ded us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the
proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had
assured us that cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In
short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at

house on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and
then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the
starboard, and that done, then ask the ﬁrst man we met where the place was: these
crooked direions of his very much puzzled us at ﬁrst, especially as, at the outset,
Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our ﬁrst point of departure—must
be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coﬃn to say it was
on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now
and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came
to something which there was no mistaking.

However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently
cheerless prospe before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mys-
tery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of
small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship bis-
cuit, and salted pork cut up into little ﬂakes; the whole enriched with butter, and
plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the
frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favorite ﬁshing food before
him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great
expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s
clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping
to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed
my seat. In a few moments the savory steam came forth again, but with a diﬀerent
ﬂavor, and in good time a ﬁne cod- chowder was placed before us.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and direions from Mrs. Hussey con-
cerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the
stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no
harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with
his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young
Stiggs coming from that unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and
a half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my ﬁrst ﬂoor back, with
his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich danger-
ous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”(for she had learned his
name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the
chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”

In bed we concoed our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small
concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently con-
sulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or
three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going
together among the whaling-ﬂeet in harbor, and in concert seleing our craft; in-
stead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the seleion of the ship should rest
wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do
so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should
infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance;
and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespeive of
Queequeg.

to point out the whaler best ﬁtted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all
my remonstrances produced no eﬀe upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce;
and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing
sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that triﬂing little aﬀair. Next

You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—squared-
toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but
take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old
Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old
fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the
typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened
like a French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her ven-
erable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,
where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiﬄy up
like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and
wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped ﬂag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where
Beckett bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous
features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded
another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal
owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had
built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness
both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be orkill-Hake’s
carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian em-
peror, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies.
A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All
round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw,
with the long sharp teeth of the Sperm Whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten
her old hempen thews and tendons to. ose thews ran not through base blocks
of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile
wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one
mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. e
helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he
holds back his ﬁery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most
melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.

Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But
unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things,
and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all triﬂes—Captain
Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the striest se of Nan-
tucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad,
lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born
Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still,
for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about
worthy Captain Bildad. ough refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear
arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and
Paciﬁc; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-
bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contem-
plative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminis-
cence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man’s religion
is one thing, and this praical world quite another. is world pays dividends.
Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpoon-
eer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate,
and captain, and ﬁnally a ship-owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded
his adventurous career by wholly retiring from aive life at the goodly age of sixty,
and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
Now Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible
old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. ey told me in
Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old
Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore
to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for
a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted to say the least. He never used to
swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of
cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have
his drab-colored eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till

But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving
a generous share of the proﬁts was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both
Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the
principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable
and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship’s aﬀairs to these
two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal
to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own ﬁreside.
Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad,
to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these
proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his
book,“ Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”

Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible
owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel
so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the
door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish
from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down
again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention
of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for
Peleg, after letting oﬀ his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he,
too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.
“Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall’s gone oﬀ to leeward, I think. Bildad,
thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife
here needs the grindstone. at’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,

years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers,
doors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of merchant vessels,
yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great
length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of
the ﬁshery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually
frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most
exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruion and loss of the

very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it, nothing should
be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she
would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time
with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time
with a roll of ﬂannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back. Never did any
woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt Charity, as everybody
called her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about

yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved
brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of

getting better and better, and was expeed aboard every day; meantime, the two
Captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to ﬁt the vessel

very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so
long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute
diator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man

and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as
if they were to be joint- commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.
And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; Only, they said
he was in the cabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means
necessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,
as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he was not yet
completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below. And
all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service many captains
never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor,
but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merrymaking with their shore
friends, before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.

addition to his other oﬃces, was one of the licensed pilots of the port—he being
suspeed to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee
to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I
say, might now be seen aively engaged in looking over the bows for the approach-
ing anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to
cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the
girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days previ-
ous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the
Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a
small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.

speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward;
looked towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-oﬀ unseen
Eastern Continents; looked towards the land, looked aloft; looked right and left;
looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its
pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for
a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say, “Nevertheless,

Why did the Dutch in DeWitt’s time have admirals of their whaling ﬂeets?
Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, ﬁt out whaling ships
from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from
our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the years  and 
pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of lb. ,,? And lastly, how
comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded
whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by
eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming ,, of dollars; the ships worth,

But this is not the half; look again.
I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point out
one single peaceful inﬂuence, which within the last sixty years has operated more
potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the high
and mighty business of whaling. One way and another, it has begotten events
so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential
issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore oﬀ-
spring themselves pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task
to catalogue all these things. Let a handful suﬃce. For many years past the whale-
ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the
earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook
or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and european men-of-war now peace-
fully ride in once savage harbors, let them ﬁre salutes to the honor and glory of the
whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and ﬁrst interpreted between
them and the savages. ey may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring
Expeditions, your Cookes, Your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous
Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your
Cooke and your Krusenstern. For in their succorless emptyhandedness, they, in
the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,
battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his marines and mus-
kets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a ﬂourish of in the
old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of our

It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones,
a certain curious process of seasoning them for their funions is gone through.
ere is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a caster of state. How they
use the salt, precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head
is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though,
that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint
machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of
this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly
a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a
mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a
quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to much in his
totality.

:: _e_chief_mate_of_the_Pequod_was_Starbuck__a_nat... <2180,428>

e chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker
by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed
well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his ﬂesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit.
Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must
have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those
fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he
seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superﬂuousness. But this, his
thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares,
than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation
of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight
skin was an excellent ﬁt; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner
health and strength, like a reviviﬁed Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to
endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or
torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well
in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering
images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A
staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of aion,
and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
were certain qualities in him which at times aﬀeed, and in some cases seemed
well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman,
and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life
did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition,
which in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence
than from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And
if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-
away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him
still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to

With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain supersti-
tiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could, nevertheless,
still ﬂourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature
that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as
he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering
an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from
its conﬁnement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was
that sort of bravery chieﬂy, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally
abiding ﬁrm in the conﬂi with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary
irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more terriﬁc, because
more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow
of an enraged and mighty man.

that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. ou shalt see it shining

:: Stubb_was_the_second_mate <2535,262>

Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according
to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod- man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven
nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indiﬀerent air; and while engaged
in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and colleed as a
journeyman joiner engaged for the year. Good- humored, easy, and careless, he
presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and
his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement
of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When
close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the ﬁght, he handled his unpitying
lance coolly and oﬀ-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum
over his old rigadig tunes while ﬂank and ﬂank with the most exasperated monster.
Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair.
What he thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of
it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way
after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of
call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something
which he would ﬁnd out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.

e third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A short,
stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow
seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily aﬀronted
him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to destroy them
whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the
many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything
like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his
poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magniﬁed mouse, or at least
water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time
and trouble in order to kill and boil. is ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his
made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he followed these ﬁsh for the fun
of it; and a three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut
nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought
ones; made to clinch tight and last long. ey called him King-Post on board of
the Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber
known by that name in Aric whalers; and which by the means of many radiating
side timbers inserted in it, served to brace the ship against the icy concussions of
those battering seas.

Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a
village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket
with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the ﬁshery, they usually go by the
generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek
bones, and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but
Antaric in their glittering expression—all this suﬃciently proclaimed him an
inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of
the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of
the main. But no longer snuﬃng in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland,
Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring
harpoon of the son ﬁtly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look at
the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the
superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half believed this wild Indian to
be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second
mate’s Squire.

ird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal- black negro-
savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears
were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and would
talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntar-
ily shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And
never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pa-
gan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years
the bold life of the ﬁshery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men they shipped; daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and ere
as a giraﬀe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet ﬁve in his socks.
ere was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing
before him seemed a white ﬂag come to beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell,
this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked
like a chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it
said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
mast employed in the American whale ﬁshery, are Americans born, though pretty
nearly all the oﬃcers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale ﬁshery
as with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the engineer-
ing forces employed in the construion of the American Canals and Railroads.
e same, I say, because in all these cases the native American liberally provides
the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small
number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound
Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peas-

their crew. Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it
is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. ey were
nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging
the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent
of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!
An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of
the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the pequod to lay the world’s grievances
before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little
Pip —he never did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim
Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of
the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike
in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a

Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft
to mark if any strange face were visible; for my ﬁrst vague disquietude touching the
unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation.
is was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoher-
ences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before
conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of
the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—to call it
so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed
against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the harpooneers, with
the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set
than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences
had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this —and rightly ascribed it—to
the ﬁerce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in
which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspe of the
three chief oﬃcers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to
allay these colorless misgivings, and induce conﬁdence and cheerfulness in every
presentment of the voyage. ree better, more likely sea-oﬃcers and men, each in
his own diﬀerent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of them

ere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the re-
covery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the ﬁre
has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away
one particle from their compaed aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,
seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini’s
cast Perseus. reading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing
right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his
clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that per-
pendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when
the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig,
peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running oﬀ into the soil,
leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with
him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could cer-
tainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was
made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head
Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years
old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed
inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral
man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye
upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities,
popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment.
So that no white sailor seriously contradied him when he said that if ever Cap-
tain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to pass, so
he muttered—then, whoever should do that last oﬃce for the dead, would ﬁnd a
birth-mark on him from crown to sole.

I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the
Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizen shrouds, there was an auger
hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg steadied in
that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood ere,
looking straight out beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. ere was an inﬁnity
of ﬁrmest fortitude, a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the ﬁxed and
fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
oﬃcers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions,
they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness of being under a
troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before
them with a cruciﬁxion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of
some mighty woe.

Ere long, from his ﬁrst visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after
that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his pivot-
hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the deck. As the
sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and
less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead
wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he
said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there
as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly
cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully
competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or
excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer
upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to
pile themselves upon.

threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. e warmly cool, clear, ringing,
perfumed, overﬂowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sher-
bet, heaped up—ﬂaked up, with rose-water snow. e starred and stately nights
seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the
memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping
man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights.
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells
and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially
when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the
clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and

to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere
long the old man would emerge, griping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
way. Some considerating touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he
usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been the rever-
berating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would have been of the
crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common
regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from
taﬀrail to mainmast, Stubb, the odd second mate, came up from below, and with
a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was
pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might be some
way of muﬄing the noise; hinting something indistinly and hesitatingly about

some folks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse
nor a toothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from

But there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s

“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory
leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my
soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right oﬀ! And then, presto! Ahab seemed
a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more
curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams are— through all this rage that
I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not
much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. “Why,” thinks I, “what’s the row? It’s
not a real leg, only a false leg.” And there’s a mighty diﬀerence between a living
thump and a dead thump. at’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, ﬁfty
times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. e living member—that
makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,
while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly
contradiory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, “what’s his
leg now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,” thinks I, ”it was only a playful
cudgelling—in fa, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Be-
sides,” thinks I, “look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what a small
sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, there’s a devilish
broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.” But now comes
the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid,
a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
shoulders, and slews me round. ”What are you ’bout?” says he. Slid! man, but I

second thoughts, oqq. I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.” “Wise Stubb,” said he,
“wise Stubb;” and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums
like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his “wise Stubb,
wise Stubb,” I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had
only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, “Stop that kicking!” “Halloa,”
says I, “what’s the matter now, old fellow?” “Look ye here,” says he; “let’s argue
the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?” “Yes, he did,” says I—“right here
it was.” “Very good,” says he—“he used his ivory leg, didn’t he?” “Yes, he did,”
says I. “Well then,” says he, “wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he
kick with right good will? It wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was
it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s
an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest
lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of;
but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man
of. Remember what I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on
no account kick back; for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that
pyramid?” With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion,
to swim oﬀ into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock!
“Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”

Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever
saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and
whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subje of the Greenland
or Right-Whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing
and says nothing of the great Sperm Whale, compared with which the Greenland
Whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland
Whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means
the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous
and utterly unknown Sperm-Whale, and which ignorance to this present day still
reigns in all but some few scientiﬁc retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has
been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the
great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland Whale, without one
rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new
proclamation. is is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the Greenland
Whale is deposed,—the great Sperm Whale now reigneth!

lish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa Whale, and the Physeter Whale, and the
Anvil Headed Whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsﬁch of
the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt,
the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter;
the most majestic in aspe; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he
being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is ob-
tained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is
chieﬂy with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is ab-
surd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm Whale was almost wholly unknown
in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained
from the stranded ﬁsh; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly sup-
posed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England
as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti
was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the ﬁrst syllable of the
word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,
not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only
to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When,
as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its
original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
notion so strangely signiﬁcant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last
have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really
derived.

monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall- Spout, and Long-John,
has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet
is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-
tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the Right
Whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His
great lips present a cable-like aspe, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of
large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the ﬁn, from which he derives
his name, is often a conspicuous obje. this ﬁn is some three or four feet long,
growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with
a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be
visible, this isolated ﬁn will, at times, be seen plainly projeing from the surface.
When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and
this gnomon- like ﬁn stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it
may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a
dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow
often goes back. e Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some
men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpeedly rising to the
surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet
rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such won-
drous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man;
this Leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing
for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the
Fin-Back is sometimes included with the Right Whale, among a theoretic spe-
cies denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so
called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which,
however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed
whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the ﬁsher-
men’s names for a few sorts.

better adapted to aﬀord the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other
detached bodily distinions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then?
e baleen, hump, back-ﬁn, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what

each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the
same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form
such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an
irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such
a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.

classify the Greenland Whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various

the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and
boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted;

well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved

averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latit-

looks something like a Roman nose. When not more proﬁtably employed, the
Sperm Whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena Whale, to keep up the sup-
ply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the
absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead
of odorous wax. ough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield

used like the blade of the sword-ﬁsh and bill-ﬁsh; though some sailors tell me that
the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food.
Charley Coﬃn said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the
surface of the Polar Sea, and ﬁnding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so
breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be corre. My
own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Nar-
whale—however that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a
folder in reading pamphlets. e Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked Whale,
the Horned Whale, and the Unicorn Whale. He is certainly a curious example of
the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From
certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn’s horn
was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such,
preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts
for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufaured
into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an obje of great curiosity.
Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,
when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of
Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the ames; when Sir Martin re-
turned from that voyage, saith Black Letter, on bended knees he presented to her
highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after
hung in the castle at Windsor. An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on
bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a
land beast of the unicorn nature.

Beyond the Duodecimo, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the Por-
poise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans of note.
But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an
American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate
them by their forecastle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of
the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be
incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Oavo, or Duodecimo mag-
nitude:—e Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale;
the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the
Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the
Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might
be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth
names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspeing
them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing. Finally: It
was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, per-
feed. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word. But I now leave
my cetological System standing thus unﬁnished, even as the great Cathedral of
Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted
tower. For small ereions may be ﬁnished by their ﬁrst archites; grand ones, true
ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever completing
anything. is whole book is but a draught —nay, but the draught of a draught.
Oh Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience! I am aware that down to the present
time, the ﬁsh styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-ﬁsh and Sow-ﬁsh of the Coﬃns
of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these
pig-ﬁsh are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and
feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials
as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of
Cetology. Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former
order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in ﬁgure, yet the book-
binder’s Quarto volume in its diminished form does not preserve the shape of the
Folio volume, but the Oavo volume does.

:: _e_large_importance_attached_to_the_harpooneer_... <3857,597>

e large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by the
fa, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the
command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the cap-
tain, but was divided between him and an oﬃcer called the Specksynder. Literally
this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief
Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s authority was restried to the navigation
and general management of the vessel: while over the whale-hunting department
and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In
the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old
Dutch oﬃcial is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present
he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s
more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good condu of the harpoon-
eers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American
Fishery he is not only an important oﬃcer in the boat, but under certain circum-
stances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship’s deck is
also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should
nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distin-
guished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded
as their social equal.

proﬁts, not upon ﬁxed wages, but upon their common luck, together with their
common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some
cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet,
never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in
some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punilious externals, at
least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done
away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military
navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial

white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs. In his own
proper turn, each oﬃcer waited to be served. ey were as little children before
Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.
With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved
the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they would have
profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic
as the weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the
slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the
mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little
started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly;
and swallowed it, not without circumspeion. For, like the Coronation banquet at
Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial
Eleors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence;
and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb.
What a relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary
family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have been the
drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to
him tantamount to larceny in the ﬁrst degree. Had he helped himself at that table,
doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest
world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped
himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did
Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the

happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his
repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls
that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. ere-
fore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the
dignity of an oﬃcer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much relieve his
hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaion, thought Flask, have
for ever departed from my stomach. I am an oﬃcer; but, how I wish I could ﬁst
a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the
mast. ere’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of glory: there’s the
insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a
grudge against Flask in Flask’s oﬃcial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order
to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask

had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, har-
poonwise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy’s
memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle pre-

:: It_was_a_sight_to_see_Queequeg_seated_over_agai... <2648,2287>

It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his ﬁled
teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the ﬂoor, for a bench
would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion of
his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an African
elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully
abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diﬀused through so broad, baronial,
and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep
of the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuﬀed in the
sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished.
But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly
sound enough—so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see
whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would
hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
picked, the simple-witted Steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round
him in the pantry, by his sudden ﬁts of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which
the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other weapons; and
with which whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives;
that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could
he forget that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough- Boy! hard fares
the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his
arm, but a buckler. in good time, though, to his great delight, the three salt-sea
warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their
martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there;
still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in it
except at meal-times, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed through it
to their own peculiar quarters.

might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when
they did enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards
for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing
in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no companion-
ship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. ough nominally included in the census
of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as the last of
the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had
departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree,
lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling
old age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the
sullen paws of its gloom!

:: Now__as_the_business_of_standing_mast-heads__as... <1133,435>

Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or aﬂoat, is a very ancient
and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest
standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I
ﬁnd none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel,
must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all
Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the ﬁnal truck was put to it) as that great stone
mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God’s
wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.
And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based
upon the general belief among archaeologists, that the ﬁrst pyramids were founded
for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-
like formation of all four sides of those ediﬁces; whereby, with prodigious long
upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex,
and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a
sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit
of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with
a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-

heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or
sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of
modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and
bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiﬀ gale, are still entirely
incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight.
ere is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendôme, stands with
arms folded, some one hundred and ﬁfty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules
the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great
Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and
like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur
beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-
metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by
that London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there
is smoke, must be ﬁre. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson,
will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to befriend by their
counsels the distraed decks upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised,
that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what
shoals and what rocks must be shunned.

It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respe the mast-head standers of
the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an
item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.
e worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale ﬁshery, ere ships
were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island ereed
lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed
cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen- house. A few years ago this same
plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom
has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a
whale-ship at sea. e three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-
set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other
every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant
the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. ere you stand,
a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts
were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim
the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the
famous Colossus at old Rhodes. ere you stand, lost in the inﬁnite series of the
sea, with nothing ruﬄed but the waves. e tranced ship indolently rolls; the
drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part,
in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news;
read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude
you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic aﬄiions; bankrupt

In one of those southern whalemen, on a long three or four years’ voyage, as
often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would
amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place
to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural
life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness,
or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a
hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and
snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual
point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin
parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here,
tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a
bull’s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you,
in the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no
more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its ﬂeshly
tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without
running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps
in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or
additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your
body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.

Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a south-
ern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits, called
crow’s-nests, in which the lookouts of a Greenland whaler are proteed from the
inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the ﬁre-side narrative of Captain Sleet,
entitled “A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and in-
cidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in
this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly
circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow’s-nest of the Glacier,
which was the name of Captain Sleet’s good craft. He called it the Sleet’s crow’s-
nest, in honor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free
from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so
likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may be-
get. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is
open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to
windward of your head in a hard gale. Being ﬁxed on the summit of the mast,
you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side,
or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath
for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep

your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When
Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow’s nest of his, he tells us
that he always had a riﬂe with him (also ﬁxed in the rack), together with a powder
ﬂask and shot, for the purpose of popping oﬀ the stray Narwhales, or vagrant sea
unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the
deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very
diﬀerent thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe,
as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so
enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientiﬁc account
of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the
purpose of counteraing the errors resulting from what is called the “local attrac-
tion” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the
iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having been so
many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain
is very discreet and scientiﬁc here, yet, for all his learned “binnacle deviations,”
“azimuth compass observations,“ and “approximate errors,” he knows very well,
Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
meditations, as to fail being attraed occasionally towards that well replenished
little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within easy
reach of his hand. ough, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the
brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should
so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it
must have been, while with mittened ﬁngers and hooded head he was studying
the mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the
pole.

tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the

furnishes !n asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent- minded young
men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar and
blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of
some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:— “Roll
on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over
thee in vain.” Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling suﬃcient “interest”
in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambi-
tion, as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.
But all in vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfe;
they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? ey have left

there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an
opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth
by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottom-
less soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding,
beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising ﬁn of some un-

only people the soul by continually ﬂitting through it. In this enchanted mood,

How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me,
the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught

For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm
Whale ﬁshermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them,
comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had au-
ally and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large
number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along sol-
itary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch,
to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each
separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with
other circumstances, dire and indire, long obstrued the spread through the
whole world-wide whaling-ﬂeet of the special individualizing tidings concerning
Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have en-

of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief
to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an un-
fair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than
moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale ﬁshery had been marked by various
and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the mon-
ster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to

naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,—as the smitten
tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra
ﬁrma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to
cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale ﬁshery
surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen as a
body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors;
but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most direly brought into conta with
whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its
greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest
waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores,
you would not come to any chiselled hearthstone, or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a calling
as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by inﬂuences all tending to make his fancy

And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times
thrown its shadow before it; we ﬁnd some book naturalists —Olassen and Povel-
son—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other
creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst
for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost
similar impressions eﬀaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself aﬃrms
that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all ﬁsh (sharks included) are “struck with the
most lively terrors”, and “often in the precipitancy of their ﬂight dash themselves
against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death”. And how-
ever the general experiences in the ﬁshery may amend such reports as these; yet in
their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious
belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of
the hunters.

It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well
a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales
have been captured far north in the Paciﬁc, in whose bodies have been found the
barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in
some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the
two assaults could not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has
been believed by some whalemen, that the nor’ west passage, so long a problem to
man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience
of living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain
in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of
ships ﬂoated up to the surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Areth-
usa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the
Holy Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully
equalled by the realities of the whaleman.

His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at
the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade
to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. at captain was Ahab. And then
it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby
Dick had reaped away Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the ﬁeld. No
turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more
seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost
fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindiiveness against the whale, all
the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with
him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intelleual and spiritual exaspera-
tions. e White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all
those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are
left living on with half a heart and half a lung. at intangible malignity which has
been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe
one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their
statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but deliriously
transferring its idea to the abhorred White Whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated,
against it. All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;
all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the
subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly person-

It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the pre-
cise time of his bodily dismemberment. en, in darting at the monster, knife
in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and
when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bod-
ily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards
home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched to-
gether in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian
Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and
so interfusing, made him mad. at it was only then, on the homeward voyage,
after the encounter, that the ﬁnal monomania seized him, seems all but certain
from the fa that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and,
though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest,
and was moreover intensiﬁed by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace
him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he
swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more suﬀerable
latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails spread, ﬂoated across the tranquil tropics,
and, to all appearances, the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the
Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and
air; even then, when he bore that ﬁrm, colleed front, however pale, and issued
his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was
now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is of-
tentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it ﬂed, it may have but
become transﬁgured into some still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not,
but deepeningly contraed; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble North-
man ﬂows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in
his narrow-ﬂowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been
left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intelle had
perished. at before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a
furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried
it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from
having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold
more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable
obje.

e report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed
to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards,
to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his
brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his ﬁtness for another
whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that
prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was
all the better qualiﬁed and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as
the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without, with the inﬁxed,
unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would
seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of
all brutes. Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his
underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad
secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed
upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing obje of hunting the
White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed
of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls
have wrenched the ship from such a ﬁendish man! ey were bent on proﬁtable

imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and
though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal pre-eminence
in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the

imperial color the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies
to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky
tribe; and though, besides all this, whiteness has been even made signiﬁcant of
gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though

was the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typiﬁes the
majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of
kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries
of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power; by the Persian ﬁre worshippers, the white forked ﬂame being held
the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself made
incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter
sacriﬁce of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,
that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the
Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own ﬁdelity; and though direly from
the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their
sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the
holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of
the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given
to the redeemed, and the four- and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before
the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet
for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and
sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue,
which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which aﬀrights in blood.
is elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced
from more kindly associations, and coupled with any obje terrible in itself, to
heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles,
and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, ﬂaky whiteness makes
them the transcendent horrors they are? at ghastly whiteness it is which im-

eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural con-

Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative

of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a bound-

Is it that by its indeﬁniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immens-
ities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihil-
ation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in
essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color, and at
the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there is such a
dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colorless, all-
color of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory
of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely em-
blazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets
of butterﬂies, and the butterﬂy cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile de-
ceits, not aually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all
deiﬁed Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing
but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle
of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without me-
dium upon matter, would touch all objes, even tulips and roses, with its own
blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like
wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon
their eyes, so the wretched inﬁdel gazes himself blind at the monumental white
shroud that wraps all the prospe around him. And of all these things the Albino
Whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the ﬁery hunt? With reference to the
Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into
this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the
intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,

it might be said, only arises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible fero-
ciousness of the creature stands invested in the ﬂeece of celestial innocence and
love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,
the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all
this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intens-
iﬁed terror. As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same qual-
ity in the Polar quadruped. is peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in
the name they bestow upon that ﬁsh. e Romish mass for the dead begins with
Requiem eternam (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the mass itself,
and any other funereal music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of
death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him Re-
quin. I remember the ﬁrst albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in
waters hard upon the Antaric seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended
to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal,
feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.
At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy
ark. Wondrous ﬂutterings and throbbings shook it. ough bodily unharmed,
it uttered cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. rough its inex-
pressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.
As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its
wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping
memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I
cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I
awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
I never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is ut-
terly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was
some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild
Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine,
when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor
knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirely burnish
a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet. I assert, then, that in
the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chieﬂy lurks the secret of the spell; a
truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called
grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions
as when I beheld the Antaric fowl. But how had the mystic thing been caught?
Whisper it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl ﬂoated
on the sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally
round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I
doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken oﬀ in Heaven, when the
white fowl ﬂew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!

And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-
grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the widest ex-
panses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time
himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospe of a meeting.
ere was a circumstance which at ﬁrst sight seemed to entangle his deliri-
ous but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. ough the
gregarious Sperm Whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in
general you cannot conclude that the herds which hunted such and such a latitude
or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that
were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestion-
able instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same
remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among
the matured, aged Sperm Whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year
been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,
or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the pequod
to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would
infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where

way-side, antecedent, extra prospes were his, ere a particular set time or place
were attained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab
fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a certainty. at particular
set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-
the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual
round, loiters for a predied interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. ere it was,
too, that most of the deadly encounters with the White Whale had taken place;
there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where
the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in
the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw
his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest
all his hopes upon the one crowning fa above mentioned, however ﬂattering it
might be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize

sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Paciﬁc in time to cruise there.
erefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of
the Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been correly seleed by Ahab, with a view
to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and
sixty-ﬁve days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impa-
tiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance
the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical

dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day,

in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insuﬀerable
anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved
his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked
ﬂames and lightnings shot up, and accursed ﬁends beckoned him to leap down

him to burst from it in horror again. e latter was the eternal, living principle
or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the charaerizing
mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontan-
eously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which,
for the time, it was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless
leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding
up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its
own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of
self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn,
while the common vitality to which it was conjoined, ﬂed horror-stricken from
the unbidden and unfathered birth. erefore, the tormented spirit that glared
out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the
time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to
be sure, but without an obje to color, and therefore a blankness in itself. God
help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose
intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart

First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a
harpoon, has eﬀeed a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of
three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons,
both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the
instance where three years intervened between the ﬂinging of the two harpoons;
and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa,
went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents,
savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to
wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck
must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the
globe, brushing with its ﬂanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. is

saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the
respeive marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead ﬁsh. In the three-
year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, ﬁrst and last, and the
last time distinly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale’s eye,
which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty
sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally
know the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose
veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.
Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery,
however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several
memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus
marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as dis-
tinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respe any chance
whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling
him down into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the
fatal experiences of the ﬁshery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most ﬁsher-
men were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he
would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a
more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know
an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the
street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary
thump for their presumption.

First: ough most men have some vague ﬂitting ideas of the general perils
of the grand ﬁshery, yet they have nothing like a ﬁxed, vivid conception of those
perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One reason perhaps is, that not
one in ﬁfty of the aual disasters and deaths by casualties in the ﬁshery, ever ﬁnds
a public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record.
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by
the whale-line oﬀ the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the bottom
of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor fellow’s name
will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?
No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In fa,
did you ever hear what might be called regular news dire or indire from New
Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Paciﬁc,
among many others we spoke thirty diﬀerent ships, every one of which had had
a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a
boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a

when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal,
and bore direly down upon the ship. dashing his forehead against her hull, he
so stove her in, that in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not
a surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of
the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain
Pollard once more sailed for the Paciﬁc in command of another ship, but the gods
shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time
his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted

of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich
Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be
sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gen-
tlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so
smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very
good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the commodore set sail in
this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly

some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale
from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the body of which
was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not
perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full
sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against
him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,
setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water. e masts
reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly
upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this
we saw the monster sailing oﬀ with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain
D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel
had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had
escaped entirely uninjured.”

our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation that they
could hardly tell where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare
for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for
granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little
over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * e suddenness
of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were
shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun,
was thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earth-

Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his
prefeure at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring
Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those
waters for a period of more than ﬁfty years. A fa thus set down in substantial
history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what
precise species this sea- monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships,
as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined
to think a Sperm Whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that

In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called
brit is to be found, the aliment of the Right Whale. But I have every reason
to believe that the food of the Sperm Whale—squid or cuttle-ﬁsh—lurks at the
bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that
sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements
together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according
to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a century stove the
ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a Sperm Whale. e
following are extras from Chace’s narrative: “Every fa seemed to warrant me in
concluding that it was anything but chance which direed his operations; he made
two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which,
according to their direion, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being
made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objes for the shock; to
eﬀe which, the exa manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His aspe was
most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came direly from
the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck three of
his companions, as if ﬁred with revenge for their suﬀerings.” Again: “At all events,
the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and
producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief,
on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce
me to be satisﬁed that I am corre in my opinion.” Here are his reﬂeions some
time after quitting the ship, during a black night in an open boat, when almost
despairing of reaching any hospitable shore. “e dark ocean and swelling waters
were nothing; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjes of fearful contemplation,
seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and
the horrid aspe and revenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reﬂeions, until
day again made its appearance.” In another place —p. ,—he speaks of the
mysterious and mortal attack of the animal.

the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
Sperm Whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he mul-
tiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be
the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there
were still additional considerations which, though not so strily according with
the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.
To accomplish his obje Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for ex-
ample, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respes was over Starbuck,
yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere
corporeal superiority involves intelleual mastership; for to the purely spiritual,
the intelleual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Star-
buck’s coerced will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s
brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his cap-
tain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even
frustrate it.
it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale
was seen. During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open

impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must
be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men’s courage is proof
against protraed meditation unrelieved by aion); that when they stood their
long night watches, his oﬃcers and men must have some nearer things to think
of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less
capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer weather, and they inhale
its ﬁckleness—and when retained for any obje remote and blank in the pursuit,
however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite

constitutional condition of the manufaured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and
playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in
them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also
have food for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and
chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles
of land to ﬁght for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries, picking
pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they been strily
held to their one ﬁnal and romantic obje—that ﬁnal and romantic obje, too
many would have turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab,
of all hopes of cash—aye, cash. ey may scorn cash now; but let some months
go by, and no perspeive promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash
all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.

Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab

even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences
of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been

ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking

in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going
on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the
boat—oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon
the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chieﬂy to be imputed to
Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering
that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the ﬁsh-

ﬁnally considering in what a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White

from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless
he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco’s
published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after
being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary business
of ﬁtting the whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and
then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own
hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even solicitously
cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned
over the groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and particularly
his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as
if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also
the anxiety he evinced in exaly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it
is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the knee
against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he
stood up in that boat with his solitary knee ﬁxed in the semi-circular depression in
the cleat, and with the carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it
a little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the
time. But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness
in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had
already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a
supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew
being assigned to that boat.

seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude: on such a silent night
a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the
moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the sea. Fedallah ﬁrst descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was his
wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with the same
precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales were seen by
night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them. You
may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched
aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky.
But when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights
without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice
was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to
his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal
crew. ”ere she blows!“ Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have
quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. for though it was a
most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting,
that almost every soul on board instinively desired a lowering.

:: During_all_this_blackness_of_the_elements__Ahab... <3257,137>

During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time
the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested
the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In tempes-
tuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing
more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale. en Captain and
crew become praical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed
hole, and with one hand ﬁrmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would
stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would
all but congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the
forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to guard against
the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to
the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken;
and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on
through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the
same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in si-
lence the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that re-
pose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man’s aspe, when one
night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him
with closed eyes sitting straight in his ﬂoor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted
sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly drip-
ping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one
of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of. His
lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. ough the body was ere, the
head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of
the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.

As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of
a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this speral appearance was traced with
long channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the
thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set.
A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads.
ey seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that
had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the
mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship
slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each
other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those
of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking ﬁshermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed,
said not one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter- deck hail was being
heard from below.

If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally
desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in such
inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual
salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps,
sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural
that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling
vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—oﬀ lone Fanning’s Island, or
the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such circum-
stances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into still closer,
more friendly and sociable conta. And especially would this seem to be a matter
of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, oﬃcers,
and not a few of the men are personally known to each other; and consequently,
have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.

Nor would diﬀerence of country make any very essential diﬀerence; that is, so
long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and English.
ough, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do
not very often occur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness
between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does
not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers
sometimes aﬀe a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers;
regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a
sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really
consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, colleively, kill
more whales than all the English, colleively, in ten years. But this is a harmless
little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take
much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.

So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most
reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing
each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much
as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like
a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in ﬁnical
criticism upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet
at sea, they ﬁrst go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a
ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-
will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why,
they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as
possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones,
the ﬁrst hail is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How
many barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart,
for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to see overmuch of each
other’s villanous likenesses.

ere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here.
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale ﬁshery.
In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his
boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat
there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with
gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort
whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled
about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a
tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such eﬀeminacy; and therefore as in gam-
ming a complete boat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or
harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion,
and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled oﬀ to his visit all standing like a
pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole
visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain
is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. nor
is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projeing steering oar
hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by
rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and
can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a
sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length
of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread

It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound
whaleman, the Town-Ho, was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by
Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a
circumstance of the Town-Ho’s story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the
whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments
of God which at times are said to overtake some men. is latter circumstance,
with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret
part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab
or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the
Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate white seamen
of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish
injunions of secresy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and
revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well
withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an inﬂuence did this thing have on
those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such
a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept
the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-
mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly
narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange aﬀair I now proceed to put on
lasting record.

“Some two years prior to my ﬁrst learning the events which I am about rehears-
ing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising
in your Paciﬁc here, not very many days’ sail westward from the eaves of this good
Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning
upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made
more water in her hold than common. ey supposed a sword-ﬁsh had stabbed
her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that
rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to
quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, in-
deed, they could not ﬁnd it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in
rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working
at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more days went
by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much
so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the
nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.

the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the ﬂeet thunderings
of naval viories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose
red painted faces ﬂash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are
ﬂanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried
lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts
of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors;
they mirror the paved capitals of Buﬀalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago
villages; they ﬂoat alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the
State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting
blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are,
for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a midnight
ship with all its shrieking crew. us, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt
was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner
as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the
lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long
followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Paciﬁc; yet was he quite as
vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latit-
udes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with
some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil
indeed, might yet by inﬂexible ﬁrmness, only tempered by that common decency
of human recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt
had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus
far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you
shall hear.

“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow
for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again increasing, but only
so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in
a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think
little of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should
the oﬃcer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respe, the probability
would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account
of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas
far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep
clanging at their pump- handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable
retreat is aﬀorded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the
way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to
feel a little anxious.

to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze.
Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to
any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, un-
thinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen.
erefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of
the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her.
So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head
no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
continually overﬂowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain spring,
gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself
out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.

fellow-men ﬁnds one of them to be very signiﬁcantly his superior in general pride
of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike
and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that sub-
altern’s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it
may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head
like a Roman, and a ﬂowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last
viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen,
which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s

malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.

Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow

Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household work
which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it has
been known to be done in the case of ships aually foundering at the time. Such,
gentlemen, is the inﬂexibility of sea-usages and the instinive love of neatness in
seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without ﬁrst washing their
faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the
boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho
that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most
athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one
of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business
not conneed with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades.
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exaly how this aﬀair

who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this and doubtless
much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his com-
mand. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s
malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the
slow- match silently burning along towards them; as he instinively saw all this,
that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in
any already ireful being—a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant
men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over

sunny deck. But ashore, all this eﬀeminacy is dashed. e brigandish guise which
the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which
he ﬂoats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a
vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers;
I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime
redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiﬀ an arm to
back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen,
what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this; that our
wild whale-ﬁshery contains so many of its most ﬁnished graduates, and that scarce
any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling
captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the probationary
life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a
Christian corn-ﬁeld, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.

comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man
out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this
attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the vali-

manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck.
At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying
into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the obje of his resentment.
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in
gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks

confused wrangling, and then a scuﬄing was heard, as the customary summons

perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender

former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and
maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it

mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison;
and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements
with a handle at each end) run a muck from the bowsprit to the taﬀrail; and if by

could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the
ship’s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On
the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to
maintain the striest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship
reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the
voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in
case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other
perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as
willing to lower for a ﬁsh that moment, as on the day his craft ﬁrst struck the
cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a
boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passive-
ness in their condu, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning
his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the vent-
ricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated
man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the
rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming
the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances,
Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.

“No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.”—Now, gentlemen, so
suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within ﬁfty yards of the ship—forgetful of
the compa among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriﬀe
man had instinively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though
for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-
heads. All was now a phrensy. “e White Whale—the White Whale!“ was the
cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumors,
were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a ﬁsh; while the dogged crew
eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that
lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the
blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these
events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. e mutineer
was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a ﬁsh, it was his duty to sit next
him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the
line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the
mate’s got the start; and none howled more ﬁercely with delight than did Steelkilt,
as he strained at his oar. After a stiﬀ pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear
in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a
boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.
Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam

e ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon
the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to
stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this
small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was
the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they
were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put oﬀ with them in
so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his oﬃcers, he anchored the ship as far
oﬀ shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked
his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at
their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat,
steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, ﬁve hundred miles distant, to procure
a reinforcement to his crew.

e Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial

But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter’s portrait
of this ﬁsh; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s
piure of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea- monster or whale. Where
did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth,
in painting the same scene in his own “Perseus Descending”, make out one whit
better. e huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface,
scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its
distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the
Traitors’ Gate leading from the ames by water into the Tower. en, there are
the Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depied
in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of
these? As for the book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of
a descending anchor —as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many
books both old and new—that is a very piuresque but purely fabulous creature,
imitated, I take it, from the like ﬁgures on antique vases. ough universally
denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder’s ﬁsh an attempt at
a whale; because it was so intended when the device was ﬁrst introduced. It was
introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the th century, during
the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively late
period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.

the Sperm Whale. Before showing that piure to any Nantucketer, you had best
provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s
Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the
beneﬁt of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that
piure, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientiﬁc predecessor in the same

But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,
accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the
more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of
his general shape. ough Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra
in the library of one of his executors, correly conveys the idea of a burly-browed
utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal charaeristics;
yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any Leviathan’s articulated bones.
In fa, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same
relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the inse does to the chrysalis
that so roundingly envelopes it. is peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head,
as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously
displayed in the side ﬁn, the bones of which almost exaly answer to the bones of
the human hand, minus only the thumb. is ﬁn has four regular bone-ﬁngers,
the index, middle, ring, and little ﬁnger. But all these are permanently lodged
in their ﬂeshy covering, as the human ﬁngers in an artiﬁcial covering. “However
recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one day, “he
can never be truly said to handle us without mittens”.

engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depied in full majesty of might, just risen
beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terriﬁc wreck of the stoven planks. e prow of the boat is
partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster’s spine; and
standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable ﬂash of time, you behold
an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the

poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew
are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of aﬀright; while in the
black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might
be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the

which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while
the thick-lipped Leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultu-

the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American
whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline
of things, such as the vacant proﬁle of the whale; which, so far as piuresqueness
of eﬀe is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the proﬁle of a pyramid.
Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right Whaleman, after giving us a stiﬀ full
length of the Greenland Whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of Narwhales
and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping
knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck sub-

In addition to those ﬁne engravings from Garnery, there are two other French
engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself “H. Durand”.
One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless
deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of
the Paciﬁc; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water
on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the
background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. e eﬀe is very ﬁne,
when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy ﬁshermen under one of
their few aspes of oriental repose. e other engraving is quite a diﬀerent aﬀair:
the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life,
with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the a of cutting-in) hove over to
the monster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing oﬀ from this scene of
aivity, is about giving chase to whales in the distance. e harpoons and lances
lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a
sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-ere out of the water, like a rearing
horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up
like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising
up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the aivity of the excited
seamen.

beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board before him, repres-
enting the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. ere are three whales and three
boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original
integrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten
years, they tell me, has that man held up that piure, and exhibited that stump to
an incredulous world. But the time of his justiﬁcation has now come. His three
whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his
stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will ﬁnd in the western clearings.
But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor
whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
amputation.

the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants
without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of
the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the ﬁrst time beholds this species of
the Leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their immense mag-

circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it beheld,
that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the
ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true
nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the Sperm Whale
his only food. For though other species of whales ﬁnd their food above water, and
may be seen by man in the a of feeding, the Spermaceti Whale obtains his whole
food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one
can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he
will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of
them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. ey fancy that

its edge completely disengaged from everything. is arrangement of the lower
end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it
of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should
sound so deep as to threaten to carry oﬀ the entire line originally attached to the
harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it
were, from the one boat to the other; though the ﬁrst boat always hovers at hand to
assist its consort. Second: is arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s
sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were
the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as
he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly
be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no

as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves
in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size
of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a
slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some
ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it
continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to
the short-warp—the rope which is immediately conneed with the harpoon; but
previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystiﬁcations too

wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of

churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade played
at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion
from within, even but of a little ﬁnger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over
her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. us they rushed; each man with might and

their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened his ﬂight.

“Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed
in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along the ﬁsh’s ﬂank. When
reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the ﬁsh,
and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel
after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was
fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was
the innermost life of the ﬁsh. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance
into that unspeakable thing called his “ﬂurry,” the monster horribly wallowed in
his blood, over- wrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the
imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out
from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.

It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire in-
terior of the Sperm Whale’s enormous head consists. ough apparently the most
massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease he elevates
it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such
is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering
cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he
thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluﬀ-bowed sluggish galliot into
a sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat. Partly to show the indispensableness of this
a, it may here be stated, that, in the old Dutch ﬁshery, a mop was used to dash
the running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is
set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.

:: According_to_the_invariable_usage_of_the__shery... <1050,1662>

According to the invariable usage of the ﬁshery, the whale-boat pushes oﬀ
from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman, and
the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as the
harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the ﬁrst iron into the
ﬁsh; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be ﬂung
to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting
the chase, the harpooneer is expeed to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost;
indeed, he is expeed to set an example of superhuman aivity to the rest, not
only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations; and
what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles
are strained and half started—what that is none know but those who have tried it.
For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same
time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the ﬁsh, all at once
the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry— “Stand up, and give it to him!”
He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his
harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to
pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole ﬂeet of whalemen
in a body, that out of ﬁfty fair chances for a dart, not ﬁve are successful; no wonder
that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that
some of them aually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some
sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many
ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes
the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expe to ﬁnd
it there when most wanted!

But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both conneed with the
line; the obje being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the
other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out,
the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often
happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale
upon receiving the ﬁrst iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however
lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless,
as the second iron is already conneed with the line, and the line is running,
hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands.
Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line
(mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently
praicable. But this critical a is not always unattended with the saddest and
most fatal casualties.

dissatisfaion, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of
that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a
thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance
his grand, monomaniac obje. Very soon you would have thought from the sound

for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the
port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to

About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns
of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head,
as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale’s
ﬂesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands
on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on
its fatness. e few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp
slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers’ hearts.
Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing
in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out
huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. is particular
feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How, at such an apparently unassailable
surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of
the universal problem of all things. e mark they thus leave on the whale, may
best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.
ough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-ﬁght, sharks will
be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs round a table
where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed
to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus can-
nibally carving each other’s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,
the sharks, also, with their jewel- hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away
under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole af-
fair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a
shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the

A little item may as well be related here. e strongest and most reliable hold
which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the ﬂukes or
tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other
(excepting the side-ﬁns), its ﬂexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath
the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
put the chain round it. But this diﬃculty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong
line is prepared with a wooden ﬂoat at its outer end, and a weight in its middle,
while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the wooden
ﬂoat is to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the made
whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body,

e fa is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be
considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come
to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your
appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of
cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they
live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one
of their most famous doors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being
exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen,
who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that these
men aually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had
been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these
scraps are called “fritters;” which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and
crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-
cooks, when fresh. ey have such an eatable look that the most self-denying
stranger can hardly keep his hands oﬀ.

It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unuous that
landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to result,
in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i. e. that a man should
eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no
doubt the ﬁrst man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps
he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have
been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market

of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw?

In the ﬁrst place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things
comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which no single man
can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and
ﬁrmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship’s
deck. e end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then
condued to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung
over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred
pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and
Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body
for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-ﬁns. is done,
a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the main
body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense
crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side;
every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she
trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more
she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered
by a helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard;
with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and
the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular
end of the ﬁrst strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely
as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped oﬀ from the body precisely as an
orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up
by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and

called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a con-
siderable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the
second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blub-
ber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swords-
man, warning all hands to stand oﬀ, once more makes a scientiﬁc dash at the mass,
and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain;
so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-
piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. e heavers forward now resume
their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the
whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the ﬁrst strip through
the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-
room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the
long blanket- piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the
work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale
and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling,
the mates scarﬁng, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way
of assuaging the general friion.

Now, however preposterous it may at ﬁrst seem to talk of any creature’s skin
as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fa these are no
arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense
enveloping layer from the whale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost
enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape oﬀ with your
hand an inﬁnitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest
shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as ﬂexible and soft as satin; that is, previous
to being dried, when it not only contras and thickens, but becomes rather hard
and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-
books. It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed page,
I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying inﬂuence.
At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales through their own speacles, as you
may say. But what I am driving at here is this. at same inﬁnitely thin, isinglass
substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much
to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for
it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is
thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.

In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many
marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed
with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those in the ﬁnest
Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they
were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the
quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but aﬀord
the ground for far other delineations. ese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you
call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that
is the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of
the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck with a
plate representing the old Indian charaers chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic
palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too,
the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. is allusion to the Indian
rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the
exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more
especially his ﬂanks, eﬀaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason
of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspe. I should say
that those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the
marks of violent scraping conta with vast ﬂoating icebergs —I should say, that
those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also
seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile conta
with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full- grown bulls
of the species.

blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and signiﬁcant. For
the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or,
still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by
reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself
comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would become of a
Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the north, if unsupplied with
his cosy surtout? True, other ﬁsh are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean

enough to split the planets and make an inﬁdel of Abraham, and not one syllable

:: In_the_tumultuous_business_of_cutting_in_and_at... <860,1804>

In the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale, there is much
running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here,and
then again hands are wanted there. ere is no staying in any one place; for at one
and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same
with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our
way a little. It was mentioned that upon ﬁrst breaking ground in the whale’s back,
the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get ﬁxed
in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty
it was, as harpooneer to descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose
referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall
remain on the whale till the whole ﬂensing or stripping operation is concluded.
e whale be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate
parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck,
the poor harpooneer ﬂounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as
the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question.
Queequeg ﬁgured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my
eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance
to observe him, as will presently be seen.

So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while
earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinly to perceive that my own indi-
viduality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will had
received a mortal wound; and that another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge
innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. erefore, I saw that here wa a
sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even- handed equity never could have
sanioned so gross an injustice. and yet still further pondering—while I jerked
him now and then from between the whale and the ship, which would threaten
to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was
the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases he, one way
or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your
banker breaks, you nap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your
pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly es-
cape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s
monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near
sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would I only had
the management of it.

:: It_must_be_borne_in_mind_that_all_this_time_we_... <1240,1804>

It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s prodigious
head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a
while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press,
and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted
into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of
the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to
be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly
disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not
commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of
them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had
been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement
was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity oﬀered.
Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats,
Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away,
they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast- head. But suddenly in
the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news
came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and
the boats were in plain sight, in the a of being dragged right towards the ship
by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at ﬁrst it
seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within
three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the
keel. “Cut, cut!“ was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant,

seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side.
But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly,
they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might
so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical;
for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direion, and still plied
their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But
it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they
did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the
keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under
her bows, snapping and quivering; and so ﬂinging oﬀ its drippings, that the drops
fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight,
and once more the boats were free to ﬂy. But the fagged whale abated his speed,
and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two
boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.

to use him.“ “Take him,“ says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil
didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I’ll eat this

Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so
planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one piure
and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale’s eyes, eﬀeually di-
vided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like
a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separ-
ate the impressions which each independent organ imparts. e whale, therefore,
must see one distin piure on this side, and another distin piure on that
side; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man
may, in eﬀe, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined
sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted,
making two distin windows, but sadly impairing the view. is peculiarity of
the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the ﬁshery; and to be
remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.

A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual
matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a hint. so long as a
man’s eyes are open in the light, the a of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot
then help mechanically seeing whatever objes are before him. Nevertheless, any
one’s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating
sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and com-
pletely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at one and
the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.
But if you now come to separate these two objes, and surround each by a circle
of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as to
bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your con-
temporary consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in
themselves, must simultaneously a; but is his brain so much more comprehens-
ive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the same moment of time
attentively examine two distin prospes, one on one side of him, and the other
in an exaly opposite direion? If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him,
as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two
distin problems in Euclid. Nor, strily investigated, is there any incongruity in
this comparison.

But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like
the long narrow lid of an immense snuﬀ-box, with a hinge at one end, instead of
one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of teeth,
it seems a terriﬁc portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the
ﬁshery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it
to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, ﬂoating there
suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some ﬁfteen feet long, hanging straight down
at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship’s jib-boom. is whale
is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so
supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly
sort of plight, a reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws
upon him.

You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the
front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you observe
that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish
more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you
observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,
as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe
that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is
on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his
head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front. Wherefore, you must
now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall,
without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore,
you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part
of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get
near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will
soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are
now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all
that apparent eﬀeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how the

Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors

merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round
wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. at
bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken
handspikes and iron crowbars. By itself this suﬃciently illustrates the obvious fa
I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that
as ordinary ﬁsh possess what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at
will, of distension or contraion; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has
no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in
which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims
with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstrued elasticity of its
envelop; considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically occurred
to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have
some hitherto unknown and unsuspeed connexion with the outer air, so as to
be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraion. If this be so, fancy the
irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and destruive of all

e lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
oil, formed by the crossing and re-crossing, into ten thousand inﬁltrated cells, of
tough elastic white ﬁbres throughout its whole extent. e upper part, known as
the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And
as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited
forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of
his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with
the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale
contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized
spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this pre-
cious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature. ough in life it
remains perfely ﬂuid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to
concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the ﬁrst thin delicate
ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s case generally yields about ﬁve hun-

Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his ere posture,
runs straight out upon the overhanging main-yard-arm, to the part where it exaly
projes over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip,
consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing
this block, so that it hangs down from the yard- arm, he swings one end of the
rope, till it is caught and ﬁrmly held by a hand on deck. en, hand-over-hand,
down the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on
the summit of the head. ere—still high elevated above the rest of the company,
to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good
people to prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp spade being sent
up to him, he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the
Tun. In this business he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old
house, sounding the walls to ﬁnd where the gold is masoned in. By the time this
cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a well-bucket, has
been attached to one end of the whip; while the other end, being stretched across
the deck, is there held by two or three alert hands. ese last now hoist the bucket
within grasp of the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long
pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket
into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at
the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid’s pail of new
milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an
appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. en re- mounting aloft,
it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more.
Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper
and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.

To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan;
this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken.
Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized
the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and
manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater
not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces
of horses, birds, serpents, and ﬁsh; and dwells in detail upon the modiﬁcations of
expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed
to throw out some hints touching the phrenological charaeristics of other beings
than man. erefore, though I am but ill qualiﬁed for a pioneer, in the application
of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things; I

Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the
features; and since it perhaps most modiﬁes and ﬁnally controls their combined
expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external append-
age, must very largely aﬀe the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape
gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost
indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically
in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from
Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of
so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deﬁciency
which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it
is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As on
your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your
noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reﬂeion that he has a nose
to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even

In some particulars, perhaps, the most imposing physiognomical view to be
had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. is aspe is sublime.
In thought a ﬁne human brow is like the east when troubled with the morn-
ing. in the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the
grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain deﬁles, the elephant’s brow is
majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal aﬃxed
by the German emperors to their decrees. It signiﬁes “God: done this day by my
hand”. But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a
mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which
like Shakespeare’s or Melanhon’s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes
themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the
forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to
drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great
Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so
immensely ampliﬁed, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the Deity
and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other obje in living
nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distin feature is revealed;
no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one
broad ﬁrmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the
doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in proﬁle, does this wondrous brow
diminish; though that way viewed, its grandeur does not domineer upon you so.
In proﬁle, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the
forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark of genius.

particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And this
reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient
World, he would have been deiﬁed by their child-magian thoughts. they deiﬁed
the crocodile of the nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale
has no tongue, or as least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion.
If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right,
the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now
egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat,

In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length.
Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side view of a
moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in life—as we
have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is angularly ﬁlled up, and almost squared
by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end
the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the long ﬂoor
of this crater—in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as
many in depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. e brain is
at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind
its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the ampliﬁed fortiﬁcations of
Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have known some
whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than
that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.
Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems
more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of
him as the seat of his intelligence.

But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you deem
it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you
attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you will be struck with the re-
semblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudi-
mental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae
are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it
the Germans were not the ﬁrst men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it
out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which
he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I
consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing
their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe
that much of a man’s charaer will be found betokened in his backbone. I would
rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine never
yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the ﬁrm audacious
staﬀ of that ﬂag which I ﬂing half out to the world.

Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cav-
ity is continuous with the ﬁrst neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of
the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of a
triangular ﬁgure with the base downwards. As it passes through the remaining
vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large
capacity. Now, of course, this canal is ﬁlled with much the same strangely ﬁbrous
substance— the spinal cord—as the brain; and direly communicates with the
brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s cavity,
the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.
Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map out
the whale’s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the wonderful com-
parative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful
comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.

old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual yel-
lowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed aﬄied with the jaundice, or some
other inﬁrmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed ques-
tionable; for it is not customary for such venerable Leviathans to be at all social.
Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water must have
retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed
one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short,
slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending it-
self in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind him
to upbubble.

he had had, Derick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
foreign rivals. e only thing they feared, was, that from being already so nigh
to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely
overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite conﬁdent that this would
be the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
other boats.

It was a terriﬁc, most pitiable, and maddening sight. e whale was now going
head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet; while his
one poor ﬁn beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he
yawed in his faltering ﬂight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodic-
ally sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating ﬁn. So have
I seen a bird with clipped wing, making aﬀrighted broken circles in the air, vainly
striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive
cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was
chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration
through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while
still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough
to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.

But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three ti-

But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously
sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines ﬂew round the loggerheads with
such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the harpoon-
eers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their
dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on;
till at last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the
boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the gunwales of
the bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the
air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they remained in that
attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding
on,“ as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live ﬂesh from the
back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet
the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable to presume,
that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted.
Because, owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown Sperm Whale
something less than  square feet—the pressure of the water is immense. We
all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under;
even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bear-
ing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal
the weight of ﬁfty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of
twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.

writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were
visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great
Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended?

In most land anim-
als there are certain valves or ﬂood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when
wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut oﬀ in certain direc-
tions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire
nonvalvular struure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a
point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system;
and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great dis-
tance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams.
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period;
even as in a drought a river will ﬂow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-oﬀ
and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and
perilously drew over his swaying ﬂukes, and the lances were darted into him, they
were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually
playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however
rapid, sending its aﬀrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood
yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they
signiﬁcantly call it, was untouched.

“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that”!
But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet
shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than suﬀerable anguish,
the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft,
bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing
Flask’s boat and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so
spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he
had made; lay panting on his side, impotently ﬂapped with his stumped ﬁn, then
over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of
his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn oﬀ from some mighty
fountain, and with half-stiﬂed melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and
lowers to the ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.

the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking
up the steep gabled roof of a house. e ship groaned and gasped. Many of the
ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the
unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon
the immovable ﬂuke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timber-heads; and so low
had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached,
while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk,
and the ship seemed on the point of going over.

Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale
is a very curious thing; nor has any ﬁsherman yet adequately accounted for it.
Usually the dead Sperm Whale ﬂoats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly
considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old,
meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that this sink-
ing is caused by an uncommon speciﬁc gravity in the ﬁsh so sinking, consequent
upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales,
in the highest health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut oﬀ in
the warm ﬂush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even these
brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.

e gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the ﬁrst whaleman; and to the eternal
honor of our calling be it said, that the ﬁrst whale attacked by our brotherhood
was not killed with any sordid intent. ose were the knightly days of our pro-
fession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to ﬁll men’s
lamp-feeders. Every one knows the ﬁne story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the
lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and
as Leviathan was in the very a of carrying her oﬀ, Perseus, the prince of whale-
men, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the
maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers
of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very ﬁrst dart. And
let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaﬀa, on the
Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skel-
eton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the
identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa,
the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and
suggestively important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.

encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griﬃn-
like shape, and though the battle is depied on land and the saint on horseback,
yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale
was unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale
might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all
this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend
and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no other
than the great Leviathan himself. In fa, placed before the stri and piercing
truth, this whole story will fare like that ﬁsh, ﬂesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,
Dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s head and
both the palms of his hands fell oﬀ from him, and only the stump or ﬁshy part of
him remained. us, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the
tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket
should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not
the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever
had to do with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer
with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much

Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by
the ﬁrst of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and saniﬁed the
whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate
the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to
preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would
seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation, and
which therefore must have contained something in the shape of praical hints to
young archites, these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo
became incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a

One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
story was this:—He had one of those quaint old- fashioned Bibles, embellished
with curious, unscientiﬁc plates; one of which represented Jonah’s whale with two
spouts in his head —a peculiarity only true with respe to a species of the Le-
viathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the
ﬁshermen have this saying, “A penny roll would choke him;” his swallow is so very
small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,
hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly, but as
temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough
in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth would accommodate a
couple of whist tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah
might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the
Right Whale is toothless.

them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when
Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway eﬀeed his es-
cape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a ﬁgure-head; and, I
would add, possibly called “e Whale”, as some craft are nowadays christened the
“Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle”. Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists
who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant
a life- preserver—an inﬂated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam
to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag- Harbor, therefore, seems
worsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was
this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean
Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey
of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across
from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?

pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but
little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only
shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the
reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going
to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magniﬁcation
of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened
Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three centuries

in honor of Jonah, in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without

Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent.
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the ﬁnny tribes in
general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which
they swim, hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise its
head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal struure which gives
him regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by inhaling the
disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical
visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth,
for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet
beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with
his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of
his head.

for a considerable time. at is to say, he would then live without breathing.
Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who system-
atically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without
drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for,
remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his
spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like
vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with
oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless
desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary
stomachs. e anatomical fa of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the sup-
position founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me,
when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that Leviathan in having
his spoutings out, as the ﬁshermen phrase it. is is what I mean. If unmolested,
upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of
time exaly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven
minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever
he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute.
Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will
be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not
till those seventy breaths are told, will he ﬁnally go down to stay out his full term
below. Remark, however, that in diﬀerent individuals these rates are diﬀerent; but
in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?
How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all
the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast Leviathan
be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much
thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the viory to thee!

Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chieﬂy intended as it is for the
conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the
upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much
like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns
whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of
the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled
breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the
spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirely communicates with the spouting
canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to
be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s food
is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides,
if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will ﬁnd that
when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets
and the ordinary periods of respiration.

are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious
commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should
think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know
that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they
are not those identical drops superﬁcially lodged in the spout-hole ﬁssure, which
is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For even when tranquilly
swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried

water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock

is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this
conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity
and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,
inasmuch as it is an undisputed fa that he is never found on soundings, or near
shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And
I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain
semi-visible steam, while in the a of thinking deep thoughts. While composing

Sperm Whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conﬂis with man, he
chieﬂy and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves
away his ﬂukes from it, and the blow is only inﬂied by the recoil. If it be made in
the unobstrued air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies
in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly
owing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat, and the elasticity of its materials,
a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally
the most serious result. ese submerged side blows are so often received in the
ﬁshery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one strips oﬀ a frock, and
the hole is stopped.

Fifth: As in the ordinary ﬂoating posture of the Leviathan the ﬂukes lie con-
siderably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight be-
neath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire ﬂukes
with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed ere in the air, and so remain vi-
brating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime
breach—somewhere else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s ﬂukes is per-
haps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.
So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal
claw from the ﬂame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all
what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of
Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading
towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked ﬂukes. As
it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods
was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the ﬁre worshippers. As Ptolemy
Philopater testiﬁed of the African elephant, I then testiﬁed of the whale, pronoun-
cing him the most devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military
elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silence.

express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well grace
the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remark-
able, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have
declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by
these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other
motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and unaccountable to
his most experienced assailant. Disse him how I may, then, I but go skin deep;
I know him not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has
none?

ose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing mid-
way in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory,
known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway
opening into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth
of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand is-
lands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a signiﬁcant provision of nature,
that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
appearance, however ineﬀeual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western
world. e shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineer-
ing fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and
the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the obsequious
homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind,
which for centuries past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of
Sumatra and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while they
freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to
more solid tribute.

running sun has raced within his ﬁery ring, and needs no sustenance but what’s
in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are loaded
down with alien stuﬀ, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering
whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants.
She has a whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years’
water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years aﬂoat, the
Nantucketer, in the Paciﬁc, prefers to drink before the brackish ﬂuid, but yesterday
rafted oﬀ in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while
other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching
at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one
grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but ﬂoating seamen like themselves. So

As marching armies approaching an unfriendly deﬁle in the mountains, accel-

more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did this vast ﬂeet of
whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contraing the
wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling
their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats.
If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits
of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the
capture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that con-
gregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like
the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So
with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these Leviathans before

their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind,
was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist
in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to
her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck;
in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the
bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And
when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery deﬁle in which the ship was
then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his ven-
geance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing
and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless
wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with
their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab’s brow
was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has
been gnawing it, without being able to drag the ﬁrm thing from its place.

But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after
steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by the
vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the broad
waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales
had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so vioriously
gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length
they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind
now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the
herd, by some presumed wonderful instin of the Sperm Whale, become notiﬁed
of the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than
they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all
looked like ﬂashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after sev-
eral hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a general
pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now
at last under the inﬂuence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which,
when the ﬁshermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied. e compa

were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in the
Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation. In all

thither, by their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraion of
panic. is was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, com-

the pasture by three ﬁerce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such ex-
cessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is charaeristic of almost all herding
creatures. ough banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buﬀa-
loes of the West have ﬂed before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human
beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit, they will, at
the slightest alarm of ﬁre, rush helter- skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling,
jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best, therefore, withhold
any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the
beasts of the earth which is not inﬁnitely outdone by the madness of men.

ough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet
it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but
colleively remained in one place. As is customary in those cases, the boats at once
separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In
about three minutes’ time, Queequeg’s harpoon was ﬂung; the stricken ﬁsh darted
blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
straight for the heart of the herd. ough such a movement on the part of the
whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is
almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous
vicissitudes of the ﬁshery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper
into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspe life and only exist in a delirious
throb.

whose colossal ﬂukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood
up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could
reach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the oars-
men quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.
ey chieﬂy attended to the shouting part of the business. ”Out of the way,

Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are
stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other’s grain at right angles; a
line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the
other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon.
It is chieﬂy among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales
are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But Sperm Whales
are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can.
And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can
be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg
comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. e ﬁrst
and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running
oﬀ, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. ey were
cramped like malefaors with the chain and ball. But upon ﬂinging the third, in
the a of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the
seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the
oarsman in the boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the
sea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuﬀed two or three drawers and shirts
in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.

It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not
that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly diminished; moreover,
that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion, the
direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew
out, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his
parting momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the
shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here
the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not
felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called
a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown oﬀ by the whale in his more quiet
moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart
of every commotion. And still in the distraed distance we beheld the tumults
of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in
each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring;
and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have
over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to
the density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the
embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present aﬀorded us.
We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that
had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we
were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children
of this routed host.

circles, the entire area at this junure, embraced by the whole multitude, must
have contained at least two or three square miles. At any rate—though indeed such
a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our
low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention
this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up
in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented
them from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,
unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it may have
been, these smaller whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the
margin of the lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and conﬁdence, or else a still
becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs
they came snuﬄing round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it
almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted
their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the
consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.

But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still stranger
world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in those watery
vaults, ﬂoated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those that by
their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. e lake, as I have hin-
ted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants
while suckling will calmly and ﬁxedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two
diﬀerent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so did the young
of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a
bit of Gulf-weed in their new-born sight. ﬂoating on their sides, the mothers also
seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens
seemed hardly a day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and
some six feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce
yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the ﬁnal spring, the unborn whale
lies bent like a Tartar’s bow. e delicate side- ﬁns, and the palms of his ﬂukes,
still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived

in the distance evinced the aivity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging
the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the war within the
ﬁrst circle, where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were aﬀorded
them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to
and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes
the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek
to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It
is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for
hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part,
but not eﬀeually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along
with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound,
he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado
Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.

enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest
of the herd, was owing to a cause which at ﬁrst the intervening distance obscured
from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of
the ﬁshery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed;
he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the
rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-
line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his ﬂesh. So
that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently
ﬂailing with his ﬂexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and
murdering his own comrades.

producing but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to
an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously
situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards
from that. When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the
hunter’s lance, the mother’s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for

him, and chases him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like

deadly battle, and all for love. ey fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes
locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly

vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his
thousand concubines. Granting other whales to be in sight, the ﬁshermen will sel-
dom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish
of their strength, and hence their unuousness is small. As for the sons and the
daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves;
at least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous roving
lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however
much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies
all over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardor of
youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as reﬂeion lends her solemn pauses;
in short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and
virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, re-

another vessel; and herein are indirely comprised many minor contingencies,
all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,—after a weary and perilous
chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of
a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler,
who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. us the most
vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the ﬁshermen, were there
not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.

their captain snapped his ﬁngers in the plaintiﬀs’ teeth, and assured them that by
way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line, har-

:: Mr <1810,2230>

Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge.
In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position,
by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying
to bridle his wife’s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but
in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an aion to recover
possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by
saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once
had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had
as last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-ﬁsh; and
therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became
that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever harpoon might have
been found sticking in her.

gardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is the whole
of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves
but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious
landlord is the widow’s last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undeteed vil-
lain’s marble mansion with a door- plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?
What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebe-
gone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from starvation; what is
that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the archbishop of Savesoul’s income
of lb. , seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of
broken- backed laborers (all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is

Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the con-
text, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land,
the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head, and the Queen
be respefully presented with the tail. A division which, in the whale, is much
like halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under
a modiﬁed form, is to this day in force in England; and as it oﬀers in various re-
spes a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here
treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the
English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the
accommodation of royalty. In the ﬁrst place, in curious proof of the fa that the
above- mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance
that happened within the last two years.

“It is his.”
“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
“It is his.”
In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of Wellington
received the money. inking that viewed in some particular lights, the case might
by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a
rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respefully addressed a note
to his Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full
consideration. To which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were
published) that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman)
would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this the still militant old

Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a
ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside. As
we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colors from his peak; and by the
eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around
him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the ﬁshermen call a blasted
whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so ﬂoated an
unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such
a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living
are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by
some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there
those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fa that the oil obtained from such
subjes is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose.
Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had
a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay
than the ﬁrst. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that

poor devils in the ﬁshery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking
them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with
their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuﬀers, foreseeing that all
the oil they will get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all
know these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry
bones of that other precious ﬁsh he has there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat,
some one, and let’s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For
what oil he’ll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be ﬁt to burn in a jail;
no, not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to get more
oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he’ll get from
that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something
worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has
thought of that. It’s worth trying. Yes, I’m for it”; and so saying he started for the

“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb, and
with that he soon mounted to the deck. ere a queer scene presented itself. e
sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness
for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in
anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projeed from their faces
like so many jib- booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and
run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the

having broken the stems of their pipes almost short oﬀ at the bowl, were vigorously

Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article of
commerce, that in  a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coﬃn was examined at
the bar of the English House of Commons on that subje. For at that time, and
indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained,
like amber itself, a problem to the learned. ough the word ambergris is but the
French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distin. For
amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland
soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a
hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth- pieces to pipes, for
beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,
that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
pomatum. e Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same
purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome. Some wine merchants
drop a few grains into claret, to ﬂavor it.

I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise
imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch
village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by
the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a textbook on that subje.
As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order
to aﬀord a place for the blubber of the dutch whale ﬂeet to be tried out, without
being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a colleion of furnaces,
fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave
forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite diﬀerent from a South Sea Sperm
Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely ﬁlling her hold
with oil, does not, perhaps, consume ﬁfty days in the business of boiling out; and
in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. e truth is, that living or
dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill
odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages aﬀeed
to dete a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly
be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;
taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the
open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale’s ﬂukes above water dispenses a
perfume, as when a musk- scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What

In outer aspe, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar color, driven in one ec-
centric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his

pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all

Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was

the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become en-
trapped, had most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,

Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the
ﬁsh received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this
instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. e involuntary consternation of the
moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way,
that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard
with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water.
at instant the stricken whale started on a ﬁerce run, the line swiftly straightened;
and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly
dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.
Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the ﬁre of the hunt. He hated Pip
for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp
edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?“
Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed
in a ﬂash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.

But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under
very similar circumstances to the ﬁrst performance; but this time he did not breast
out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the
sea, like a hurried traveller’s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It
was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and ﬂatly
stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin hammered out
to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s ebon head showed like a
head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s in-
exorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes,
a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre
of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely
castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.

Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
whale’s ﬂesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and often par-
ticipating to a considerable degree in its unuousness. It is a most refreshing,
convivial, beautiful obje to behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly
rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots
of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in piures of citron.
Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a royal
cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have
been killed the ﬁrst day after the venison season, and that particular venison season
contemporary with an unusually ﬁne vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.

But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to
descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates. is place
has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript
and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up its
contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On
one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. ey
generally go in pairs, —a pike-and-gaﬀ-man and a spade-man. e whaling-pike
is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same name. e gaﬀ is something
like a boat-hook. With his gaﬀ, the gaﬀman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and
strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile,
the spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the
portable horse-pieces. is spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan’s
feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from
him, like a sledge. If he cuts oﬀ one of his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would
you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.

Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and
for worshipping which, king Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol,
and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the

e try-works are planted between the foremast and main-mast, the most
roomy part of the deck. e timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, ﬁtted
to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet
by eight square, and ﬁve in height. e foundation does not penetrate the deck,
but the masonry is ﬁrmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bra-
cing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the ﬂanks it is cased
with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway.
Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of
several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Some-
times they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into
them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing
them—one man in each pot, side by side—many conﬁdential communications
are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical
meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone dili-

is was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the
furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the ﬁrst
ﬁre in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After that no wood is used,
except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried
out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains consid-
erable of its unuous properties. ese fritters feed the ﬂames. Like a plethoric
burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale sup-
plies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would that he consumed his own
smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only
that, but you must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo
odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the

By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the carcase;
sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was intense.
But that darkness was licked up by the ﬁerce ﬂames, which at intervals forked forth
from the sooty ﬂues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the
famed Greek ﬁre. e burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned
to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur- freighted brigs of the bold
Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets of ﬂame
for sails, bore down upon the turkish frigates, and folded them in conﬂagrations.
e hatch, removed from the top of the works, now aﬀorded a wide hearth
in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan har-
pooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge pronged poles they pitched
hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the ﬁres beneath, till
the snaky ﬂames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. e
smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch
of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite
the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the
windlass. is served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not other-
wise employed, looking into the red heat of the ﬁre, till their eyes felt scorched in
their heads. eir tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their
matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated

curred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of
something fatally wrong. e jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against
it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I
thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my ﬁngers to the lids
and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could
see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had
been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing
seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by ﬂashes of red-
ness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood
on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern.
A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands
grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some
enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in
my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship’s stern, with
my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time
to prevent the vessel from ﬂying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing
her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the
night, and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!

Already has it been related how the great Leviathan is afar oﬀ descried from the
mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and slaughtered in the valleys
of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and how (on the prin-
ciple which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded
was killed) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how,
in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-
nego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the ﬁre;—but now it
remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehears-
ing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding of decanting oﬀ his oil into the
casks and striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns
to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas!
never more to rise and blow.

But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this self-same
ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you would all but swear
you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.
e unmanufaured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. is is the
reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an aﬀair of oil.
Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent ley is readily
made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains cling-
ing to the side, that ley quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the
bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness.
e soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which
have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. e great hatch is
scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask
is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined
and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this
conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their
own ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and ﬁnally issue to the immacu-
late deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest
Holland.

spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the old oaken
furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere. Yes; and many is
the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night;
continuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they
have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the
deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea,
and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined ﬁres
of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this,
they have ﬁnally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy

Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking
regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the multiplicity
of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in
these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each
spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular obje before him. When he
halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the
compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose;
and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the
same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the
same aspe of nailed ﬁrmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not
hopefulness.

Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and
tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s disks and stars;
ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion
stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness
and enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, R  E:
. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world,
and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway
up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those
letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a ﬂame; a tower
on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of
the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the
keystone sun entering the equinoial point at Libra.

“ere’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other
grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer. e ﬁrm
tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted,

the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every
man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now
this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the

I’ll get the almanack and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arith-
metic, I’ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with
the Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. Signs and wonders;
and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are—here they
go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here’s Gemini
himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among ’em. Aye, here on the coin
he’s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.
Book! you lie there; the fa is, you books must know your places. You’ll do to
give us the bare words and fas, but we come in to supply the thoughts. at’s
my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s navig-
ator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing
wonderful in signs, and signiﬁcant in wonders! ere’s a clue somewhere; wait a
bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the
life of man in one round chapter; and now I’ll read it oﬀ, straight out of the book.
Come, Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets
us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the ﬁrst thing; then Gemini, or the
Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer
the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies
in the path—he gives a few ﬁerce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and
hail Virgo, the Virgin! that’s our ﬁrst love; we marry and think to be happy for
aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting;
and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,
or the Scorpion, stings us in rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come
the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck
out the shafts, stand aside; here’s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full
tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-
bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or

Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from
London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the
original of the famous whaling house of Enderby and Sons; a house which in my
poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the
Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest. How long, prior to the
year of our Lord , this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
ﬁsh-documents do not make plain; but in that year () it ﬁtted out the ﬁrst
English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score
of years previous (ever since ) our valiant Coﬃns and Maceys of Nantucket
and the Vineyard had in large ﬂeets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North
and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinly recorded here, that the Nan-
tucketers were the ﬁrst among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great
Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole
globe who so harpooned him.

the ﬁrst among the nations to lower a whale- boat of any sort in the great South
Sea. e voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with
her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia’s example was soon followed by
other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the
Paciﬁc were thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their mother
only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their
expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on
a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-
Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much
does not appear. But this is not all. In , the same house ﬁtted out a discovery

Patagonian coast, and drank good ﬂip down in the forecastle. It was a ﬁne gam
we had, and they were all trumps—every soul on board. A short life to them, and
a jolly death. And that ﬁne gam I had —long, very long after old Ahab touched
her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality
of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had ﬂip? Yes, and we ﬂipped it at the rate
of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s squally oﬀ there by
Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef topsails, we were
so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly
furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast
in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts
did not go overboard; and by and bye we scrambled down, so sober, that we had
to pass the ﬂip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle
scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.

During my researches in the leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an ancient
Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must be about
whalers. e title was, ”Dan Coopman“, wherefore I concluded that this must be
the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the ﬁshery, as every whale
ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was
the produion of one “Fitz Swackhammer“. But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very
learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa
Claus and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box
of sperm candles for his trouble— this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied
the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “e Cooper”, but
“e Merchant”. In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of
the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjes, contained a very interesting
account of its whale ﬁshery. And in this chapter it was, headed “Smeer”, or “Fat”,
that I found a long detailed list of the outﬁts for the larders and cellars of  sail
of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead. I transcribe

ﬁsheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate, so that the
whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short voyage to and
from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning
 men to each of their ﬂeet of  sail, we have , Low Dutch seamen in all;
therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’
allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that  ankers of gin. Now, whether
these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been,
were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat’s head, and take good aim at ﬂying
whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit
them too. But this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well
with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern ﬁshery, beer would be
apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and
grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.

tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living ﬂowers the ﬁgures. All the trees,

the middle ones, occupied that part of the ﬁsh which, in life, is greatest in depth.
Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have
been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more
than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the liv-
ing magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked
spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in ﬂesh,
muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample ﬁns, I here saw but a few

seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his
bowels. Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and ana-
tomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fos-
siliferous, and antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
Leviathan—to an ant or a ﬂea—such portly terms might justly be deemed unwar-
rantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain
am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the diionary. And
here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course
of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson,
expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncom-
mon personal bulk more ﬁtted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale

the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire
on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and
so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To
produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring
volume can ever be written on the ﬂea, though many there be who have tried it.
Ere entering upon the subje of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a
geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason, and
also a great digger of ditches, canals, and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of
all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while
in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
completely extin; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary
formations seem the conneing, or at any rate intercepted links, between the
antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered
the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period,
which is the last preceding the superﬁcial formations. And though none of them
precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet suﬃciently
akin to them in general respes, to justify their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.
Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and
skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at the base
of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of such remains
is part of a skull, which in the year  was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in
Paris, a short street opening almost direly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and
bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s time.
Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown
Leviathanic species.

ribs, and vertebrae, all charaerized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds
of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar aﬃnities
to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by
a ﬂood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have
begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I
obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions
of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the , miles of
this world’s circumference, not an inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible.
en the whole world was the whale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along
the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like
Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s. Methuselah
seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I am horror-struck
at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale,
which, having been before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the stereotype
plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust; but upon
Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous
charaer, we ﬁnd the unmistakable print of his ﬁn. In an apartment of the great
temple of Denderah, some ﬁfty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite
ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griﬃns, and
dolphins, similar to the grotesque ﬁgures on the celestial globe of the moderns.
Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that
planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.

“Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of
which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes
cast up dead upon that shore. e Common People imagine, that by a secret Power
bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate
death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple, there are
Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light
upon ’em. ey keep a Whale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which
lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head
of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. is Rib (says John
Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. eir Historians

some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at
the Base of the Temple”.

But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. e whale of to-day is as
big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman
(more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand
how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years
before even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coﬃns as a modern
Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the
oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are
drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithﬁeld,
not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine; in
the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have
degenerated.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual ex-
tinion of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the latter part
of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much
oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged,
and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed,
those whales, inﬂuenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and
schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfre-
quent armies. at is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because
the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being
driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their
jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled
by the unfamiliar speacle.

Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the
anguish of that then present suﬀering was but the dire issue of a former woe;
and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh
perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally
with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than
equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further
than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference
from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall
have no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be
followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal

miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of
griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in
the deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly
felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom,
all heart-woes, a mystic signiﬁcance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur;
so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduion. To trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless
primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns,
and soft-cymballing, round harvest- moons, we must needs give in to this: that
the gods themselves are not for ever glad. e ineﬀaceable, sad birth-mark in the
brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.

Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more prop-
erly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other particulars concern-
ing Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain
period, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself
away with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg’s
bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as
touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every revelation partook more of signiﬁcant dark-
ness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter
did, at least. at direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness.
And not only this, but to that ever-contraing, dropping circle ashore, who, for
any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him; to that timid
circle the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for
by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spir-
its and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far
as in them lay, to muﬄe up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence
it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the
Pequod’s decks.

Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to
whaling vessels, he was, to a certain oﬀ-handed, praical extent, alike experienced
in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the carpenter’s pursuit being
the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more
or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material. but, besides the application
to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly ef-
ﬁcient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring
in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in uncivilized and far- distant
seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats,
sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in
the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters
more direly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly
expert in all manner of conﬂiing aptitudes, both useful and capricious.

:: _us__this_carpenter_was_prepared_at_all_points_... <3900,2514>

us, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indiﬀerent and without
respe in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks;
men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a ﬁeld
thus variously accomplished, and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too;
all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not
precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain imper-
sonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded oﬀ into the surround-
ing inﬁnite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in
the whole visible world; which while pauselessly aive in uncounted modes, still
eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathed-
rals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an
all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-
like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a
certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the
midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old car-
penter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only
had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed oﬀ whatever small outward
clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstra; an
unfraioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without pre-
meditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this
strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his
numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instin, or
simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even
or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process.
He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early
oozed along into the muscles of his ﬁngers. He was like one of those unreasoning
but still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheﬃeld contrivances, assuming the ex-
terior—though a little swelled —of a common pocket knife; but containing, not
only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-ﬁlers, counter-sinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the car-
penter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of him, and the
screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.

sound, and that the leak must be further oﬀ. So, it being calm weather, they broke
out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and
from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.
So deep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspe of the
lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone
cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly
warning the infatuated old world from the ﬂood. Tierce after tierce, too, of water,
and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted
out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed
under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled
in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless
student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit

to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness
and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or an
ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the
heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last,
after some days’ suﬀering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the
door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days,
till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else
in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed
growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but
deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that
immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like circles
on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding
and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would
steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange
things in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For
whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or
books. And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.
So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier
thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of
poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea
seemed gently rocking him to his ﬁnal rest, and the ocean’s invisible ﬂood-tide

Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what
he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked. He called
one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and taking
his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes
of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had
learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark
canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not
unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched
him out in his canoe, and so left him to be ﬂoated away to the starry archipelagoes;
for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible
horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interﬂow with the blue heavens;
and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at
the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual sea-custom,
tossed like something vile to the death- devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe
like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that
like a whale-boat these coﬃn-canoes were without a keel; though that involved
but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.

attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from
it, and then had the iron part placed in the coﬃn along with one of the paddles
of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides
within: a ﬂask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody
earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up
for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his ﬁnal bed, that he might
make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes,
then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. en crossing his
arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coﬃn lid (hatch he called
it) to be placed over him. e head part turned over with a leather hinge, and
there lay Queequeg in his coﬃn with little but his composed countenance in view.
Rarmai (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in

But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that
his coﬃn was proved a good ﬁt, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no
need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted
surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was
this;—at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was
leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not
die yet, he averred. ey asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter
of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it
was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness
could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
unintelligent destroyer of that sort.

With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coﬃn for a sea- chest; and emptying
into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many spare hours he
spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque ﬁgures and drawings; and it
seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted
tattooing on his body. And this tattooing, had been the work of a departed prophet
and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his
body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on
the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle
to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself
could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were
therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought it must have
been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when one morning
turning away from surveying poor Queequeg —“Oh, devilish tantalization of the

lations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet it is,
that over these sea- pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters’ Fields of all
four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and ﬂow unceasingly; for
here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms,
reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like
slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Paciﬁc, once beheld, must ever
after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the world, the
Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. e same waves wash the moles
of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race

Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge

incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some
little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and
boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to

watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s
was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no

famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced
a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every
Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night,
under cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement,
a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything.
And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly condu this burg-
lar into his family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that
fatal cork, forth ﬂew the ﬁend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent,
most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was in the basement of
his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young
and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous
pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose
reverberations, muﬄed by passing through the ﬂoors and walls, came up to her,
not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s
infants were rocked to slumber.

“Oh! that is the one, Sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
“Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though thou

At such times, under an abated sun; aﬂoat all day upon smooth, slow heaving
swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so sociably mixing with the
soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale;
these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and
brilliancy of the ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.
ese are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain ﬁlial,
conﬁdent, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he regards it as so much ﬂowery
earth; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts, seems struggling
forward, not though high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling
prairie: as when the western emigrants’ horses only show their ereed ears, while
their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.

in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round

As was afterwards learned, the bachelor had met with the most surprising

other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single ﬁsh. Not only
had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more
valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the
ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and
oﬃcers’ staterooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-
wood; and the cabin mess dined oﬀ the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down
to the ﬂoor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had aually caulked

As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the barbar-
ian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a
crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which, covered with
the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black ﬁsh, gave forth a loud roar
to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates
and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them
from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, ﬁrmly secured
aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glitter-
ing ﬁddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile,
others of the ship’s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-
works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost
thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastile, such wild cries they raised, as
the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea.

e season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab, coming
from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously
handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and would
stand there with all their eyes centrally ﬁxed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for
the order to point the ship’s prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It
was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat,
was about taking his wonted daily obervation of the sun to determine his latitude.
Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of eﬀulgences.
at unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean’s
immeasureable burning-glass. e sky looks lacquered; clouds there are none;
the horizon ﬂoats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insuﬀerable
splendors of God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with colored
glasses, through which to take sight of that solar ﬁre. So, swinging his seated
form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed
to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise
instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole
attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,
and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the
lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly
passionlessness. At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil
upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise
instant. en falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun
and murmured to himself: “ou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou
tellest me truly where I am—but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or
canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is
Moby Dick? is instant thou must be eyeing him. ese eyes of mine look into

en gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its numerous
cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered: “Foolish toy! babies’
plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the world brags
of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou do, but tell the
poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and

drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed
be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness but
scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light, O sun! Level
by nature to this earth’s horizon are the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the
crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his ﬁrmament. Curse thee,
thou quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly way by
thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line;
these shall condu me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,” lighting from the
boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest

“Who’s there?”
“Old under!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-
hole; but suddenly ﬁnding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of ﬁre.
Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry oﬀ the per-
ilous ﬂuid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each
mast, is intended to condu it into the water. But as this conduor must des-
cend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all conta with the hull; and
as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,
besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less imped-
ing the vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship’s
lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender
links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown
down into the sea, as occasion may require.

Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two
passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb.
“What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song.”
“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope they
will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have they no bowels for
a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark to look. Hear me, then:
I take that mast-head ﬂame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are
rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so,

During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s jaw-
bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic
motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it—for they were
slack —because some play to the tiller was indispensable. In a severe gale like
this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttle-cock to the blast, it is by no means
uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.
It was thus with the Pequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed
to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight
that hardly any one can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion. Some
hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the strenuous
exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the other aft—the
shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the
spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which
sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing. e
three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trysail was
set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision
again; and the course—for the present, East- south-east—which he was to steer, if
praicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the
gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing
the ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a
good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye! the foul breeze became
fair!

ﬁsh.—e very tube he pointed at me! —the very one; this one—I hold it here;

fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has
he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he
not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very
Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this
crazed old man be tamely suﬀered to drag a whole ship’s company down to doom
with him?—Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if

would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,—in there, he’s
sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can’t withstand

Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than one
case occurred to ships in violent storms. e magnetic energy, as developed in
the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the elericity beheld in
heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be. In
instances where the lightning has aually struck the vessel, so as to smite down
some of the spars and rigging, the eﬀe upon the needle has at times been still
more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic
steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle. But in either case, the
needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if
the binnacle compasses be aﬀeed, the same fate reaches all the others that may
be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.

the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of
it, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as
before. en going through some small strange motions with it—whether indis-
pensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe
of the crew, is uncertain —he called for linen thread; and moving to the binnacle,
slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-
needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At ﬁrst, the steel went round
and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place,

run oﬀ with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me
see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them
down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship’s stern. Were ever such
things done before with a coﬃn? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would
be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty
Aroostook hemlock; I don’t budge. Cruppered with a coﬃn! Sailing about with
a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads
and card-tables, as well as coﬃns and hearses. We work by the month, or by the
job, or by the proﬁt; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it
be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. hem! i’ll do the job,
now, tenderly. I’ll have me —let’s see—how many in the ship’s company, all told?
But I’ve forgotten. Any way, I’ll have me thirty separate, Turk’s- headed life-lines,
each three feet long hanging all round to the coﬃn. en, if the hull go down,

as that for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest
perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinively adopting
the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed
between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority ﬁrst. But the
captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning
all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet
missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but
unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had thus early sought
to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the
destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains
will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a protraed three or four
years’ voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their ﬁrst knowledge of a
whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father’s natural
but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.

me, against the transom, in the ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts

sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s
this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters;
glad to see ye; ﬁll up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy’s

a whale-boat once;—seen him? No! Well then, ﬁll up again, captains, and let’s

And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a preliminary
cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have chased his foe into
an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there; now, that he found himself hard
by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inﬂied;
now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had aually
encountered Moby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various
ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indiﬀerence with which the
white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that
there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which it was hardly suﬀerable for
feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, aric,
six months’ night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now
ﬁxedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It dom-
ineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain
to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.

In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished.
Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one. Alike,
joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to ﬁnest dust, and powdered, for
the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab’s iron soul. like machines, they dumbly
moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them.
But did you deeply scan him in his more secret conﬁdential hours; when he
thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even
as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance awed his; or
somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times aﬀeed it. Such an added, glid-
ing strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings
shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,
whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon
the deck by some unseen being’s body. And that shadow was always hovering

Now, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step up the deck,
unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or exaly pacing
the planks between two undeviating limits,—the main-mast and the mizen; or
else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon
the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however
motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not
swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether
he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle
for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads
of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. e clothes that the night had wet,
the next day’s sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after
night; he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin
that thing he sent for.

He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals, —breakfast and dinner:
supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as
unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base, though
perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now become one
watch on deck; and though the Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission
as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless
at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. ough
such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one word; by
night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.
At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the
starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still ﬁxedly gazing
upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the
Parsee his abandoned substance.

“I will have the ﬁrst sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab must
have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines;
and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the main-mast
head, he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one
to his basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.
is done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked
round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long
upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his
ﬁrm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the rope, Sir—I give it into
thy hands, Starbuck.” en arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word
for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope
at last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the
royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead, astern,
this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a
height.

When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the
rigging, which chances to aﬀord no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that
spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its fastened end
on deck is always given in stri charge to some one man who has the special watch
of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various diﬀerent
relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at
the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast
down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a
constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be
cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter
were not unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,
almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in
the slightest degree approaching to decision —one of those too, whose faithfulness
on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;—it was strange, that this was
the very man he should sele for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into
such an otherwise distrusted person’s hands.

led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Cap-
tain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary

fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world’s fresh bread to my mouldy
crusts —away, whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past ﬁfty,
and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pil-

poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the
boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old
Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey —more a demon than a man!—aye,
aye! what a forty years’ fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife
of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?
how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that
with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under
me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so

slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew still more smooth;
seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it
spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspeing
prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinly visible, sliding along the sea as if
an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of ﬁnest, ﬂeecy, greenish
foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projeing head beyond.
Before it, far out on the soft Turkish- rugged waters, went the glistening white
shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompany-

was keener than man’s; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he
peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no
bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it
rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of
white, glistening teeth, ﬂoating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby
Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending
with the blue of the sea. e glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an
open-doored marble tomb; and giving one side-long sweep with his steering oar,
Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. en, calling upon
Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth’s
harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.

And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale
dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being sub-
merged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for the bows
were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats involuntarily
paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that mono-
maniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him
all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the
long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe.
As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent
in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further
aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea,
midway between the two ﬂoating wrecks. ese ﬂoated aside, the broken ends
drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to
hold fast to the oars to lash them across.

But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake,
as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. e sight of the
splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast
before Antiochus’s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half
smothered in the foam of the whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to
swim, —though he could still keep aﬂoat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool
as that; helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance
shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and
mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him;
more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so revolvingly ap-
palling was the White Whale’s aspe, and so planetarily swift the ever-contraing
circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though
the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the
eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruion of the jeop-
ardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to
escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful
zone, whose centre had now become the old man’s head.

It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by
another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus continued
with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added power
of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have
treble-banked his every ﬁn; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if
now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indeﬁnitely
prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period,
such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in
some one brief vicissitude. e ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, oﬀered
the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the
boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts
of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting
everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching
it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod bore
down in the leeward wake of Moby Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals,
the whale’s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads;
and when he would be reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and
then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now? D’ye
see him?” and if the reply was, No, Sir! straightway he commanded them to lift
him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless;
anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.

steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again; were it a new-
made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the
ﬁrst of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.
Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only
feels, feels, feels; that’s tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God
only has that right and privilege. inking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a
calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that.
And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen calm, this old
skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And
still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but
no, it’s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip
it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A
vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells,
and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as
innocent as ﬂeeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more
on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there.
And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every
ﬁght it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through
it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive

continuous intense pursuit; be sure the ﬁrst is the morning, the second the noon,

in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim. Mary, girl!

At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the
White Whale’s ﬂank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance—as the whale
sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which,
thrown oﬀ from the whale’s spout, curled round his great, Monadnock hump;
he was even thus close to him; when, with body arched back, and both arms
lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted his ﬁerce iron, and his far ﬁercer
curse into the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh ﬂank
against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat
over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then
clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea.

had darted from their various employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon
the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head,
sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed.
Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspe, and spite of
all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the
ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell ﬂat upon their faces.
Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like
necks. rough the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down

“I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! Let me hear thy hammer.
Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-
bullied hull; thou ﬁrm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow, —death-
glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut oﬀ from the last
fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh,
now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your
furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and
top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying
but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at
thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coﬃns and all hearses
to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces,
while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! us, I give up
the spear!”

But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken
head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the ere spar yet vis-
ible, together with long streaming yards of the ﬂag, which calmly undulated, with
ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched;—at that in-
stant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in
the a of nailing the ﬂag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk
that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
among the stars, pecking at the ﬂag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird
now chanced to intercept its broad ﬂuttering wing between the hammer and the
wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage be-
neath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven,
with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole cap-
tive form folded in the ﬂag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan,
would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her,
and helmeted herself with it.

It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the Fates
ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman assumed the
vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from
out the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So. ﬂoating on the margin of the
ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the half-spent suion of the sunk ship
reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When
I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and
ever contraing towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
wheeling circle, like another ixion I did revolve. Till gaining that vital centre, the
black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
and owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coﬃn like-buoy shot
lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and ﬂoated by my side. Buoyed up by that
coﬃn, for almost one whole day and night, I ﬂoated on a soft and dirge-like main.
e unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the
savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near,
nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her
retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.
